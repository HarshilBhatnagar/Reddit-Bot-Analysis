1buy0w0,1712164028.0,Competitive_Fudge_96,Admitting that PM Modi is bad for the country but still willing to vote for the BJP because he's better than the 'incompetent' Rahul Gandhi is probably the stupidest opinion ever.,"This is India. We have a parliamentary form of elections. It's not Mr. Modi verses Mr. Gandhi. It's not even Congress vs BJP. It's an election where countless parties contest. 

It is clearly evident that Mr. Modi and the BJP are driving this nation into an autocratic regime. The currently elected NDA government is misusing their authority over the agencies of the Union Government. The BJP has an extremely well-built and successful propaganda machinery, called the BJIP IT Cell, that is curbing the influence of other political parties in the country. 

Not a day goes by where they do not cyberbully Mr. Gandhi. If the BJP believes that he is incompetent, why did they spend more than a decade trying to defame him? To the BJP, Mr. Gandhi is a threat. A threat that they cannot 'purchase and subdue' like the other MLAs, MPs, and political leaders they have purchased so far.

Let's make a comparison between the two:

1. Media: The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra received almost zero media attention, while any speech given Mr. Modi is broadcasted live on all of our national news channels. Indian media has reached such a sorry state that Mr. Gandhi has to upload his press conferences on his own YouTube channel while none of the **24/7 news channels** could accommodate to broadcast it in their ever-busy schedules. The BJP has complete control over the media and it is evident that no matter who the opposition is, they are going to be shunned by the media.
2. Charisma and Strongman Personality: The voters of this country should realise that we are voting the leaders who will be governing the country for the next five years. We are not voting for actors on a Bollywood fan website for the most charismatic personality. Charisma does not help in internal policy making. Strongman personality does nothing to help India's geopolitical influence in any sort. Politics and elections are not supposed to be entertainment. Showmanship exists only to sway the voters.
3. Press Conferences: Mr. Modi is never willing to face the public or the journalists. Mr. Gandhi has not shied away from it. Are we truly democratic if we never have the ability to question our elected representatives?
4. Religion: Communal violence is rising. The secularism of India is being threatened on a daily basis, and yet, there aren't many voices raising this concern. India is a home to all religions, and including atheists. The BJP advocates the dominance of one religion over others. 

The BJP wants to turn elections into something similar to the US Presidential elections. They cherry-pick the ones that are beneficial to them and drop the rest. Why can we not have a platform similar to the Presidential debates on live TV? Let Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi debate over the pressing issues of the nation. Let the voters see the real competencies and opinions of both leaders (and others too) and then decide who would be beneficial to the nation.

How is Mr. Gandhi incompetent when the public has not even heard of him and his work outside of the echoes of the BJP's propaganda machinery? Even a person who does neither beneficial nor harm to the country is better than a person who is detrimental. A majority of the decisions are taken by the bureaucrats and the elected representatives exist as a mere overlooking body. The miniscule decisions taken are by the elected representatives and these decisions make or break the country. Choose wisely.  


PS: I am not affiliated to any political party, and I am not asking anyone to vote for the Congress and Mr. Gandhi. I am just a staunch believer that the majority of the people are in a dire need of a paradigm shift.",2010,681

18dg434,1702014822.0,Traditional_Age_9365,A common person's view of BJP government since their rule started in 2014,"
This post is divided into pros & cons of Modi govt from 2014 to date.

Pros
1) rapid growth & improvement in transport infrastructure.
2) make in india initiative which enhanced the manufacturing capacity of india in some aspects & increased both domestic & foreign exports of various goods. The export sector has particularly improved.
3) terrorist attacks on civilians declined considerably. Excluding J&K, the overall civilian safety from terrorist attacks is now far better.
4) the no: of international companies & their investments increased.
5) military has been modernised & equipped with better quality weapons & various other tools to some extent.

Cons
1) various botched projects/policies such as demonetisation, GST, farmers' issues, manipur ethnic class issues, delhi/uttar pradesh communal violence & riots, aadhar card data leaks, wrestlers' issues, covid lockdown & vaccine policy & so on. Demonetisation was a fiasco. It was a ludicrous policy by govt. GST was bungled by govt to a huge extent.
2) disdain for human rights.
3) fundamentalism/bigotry & peddling of pseudoscience.

4) controlled mass media (godi media)
Bjp/nda supporters & followers while defending godi media should understand that media was one of the paramount reasons for the defeat of congress/upa government. During the rule of congress/upa govts, media was far more independent & powerful. A lot of medias were against govt. They often criticised & trolled govt. They informed the general public about govt's various issues & faults from time to time. Some of the national medias were usually on their toes to chase & find out the govt's misdeeds. This was especially very evident during the UPA 2 govt. To put it in a nutshell, media was the 4th pillar of democracy during those days. But unfortunately, today that's no more the case.

5) distraction of actual issues by diverting public attention to islamophobia/christianophobia/sikophobia & pakistan/china along with ever growing nationalism & jingoism to also deviate people from other relevant issues (to be not confused with patriotism which is the positive side).
6) religion (hinduism) and various government policies/actions are mixed with each other.
7) protection & garlanding of rapists & hate speech proponents.
8) rampant crony capitalism and all level govt corruption (gautam adani & PM CARES fund are apt examples).
9) complete lack of transparency in various govt accountability matters/incidents such as PM CARES fund.
10) suppression of citizen participation in democratic processes like RTI & improper response given to their queries by RTI.
11) inauguration of half-baked infrastructure projects. Many of these projects were & are incomplete with lack of property quality, safety & reliability at the time of their inauguration & thereafter.
12) make in india project's vision was not fully realised. There were several issues with it in respect to quality & reliability of various products. The govt failed to extensively utilise its scope & further potential.

Another point worth noting is whataboutism & blame games that are some of the major tactics which are often used by BJP govt as a part of their strategy to conceal their faults, responsibility & accountability. Although they have been ruling India for nearly a decade now & had also ruled india in some other terms before 2014, but they still keep on blaming Congress/UPA for any issues & faults which is hypocrisy to the peak. But what they fail to understand or intentionally don't realise is that they were overwhelmingly elected to form govt by the majority of indians in 2014 to fix the issues & faults of Congress/UPA government terms. But it turned out that BJP govt is far more evil & corrupted to the core along with their communal hate & divisive politics.

Anyway, these lists are by no means exhaustive.",1144,298
11zjnpc,1679576414.0,Time-Profession6258,It has been nine years since the last time an Indian Prime Minister took a Press Conference,"What is the reason behind the absence of any press conferences by Prime Minister Modi during his 9-year tenure, and why is the media not emphasizing this matter?

The problem is that for almost a decade, India has been operating under an opaque veil of distorted truths and post-truths since the BJP took power, resulting in a concerning lack of transparency in governance.

During these Modi years, an honest political or economic analyst would be confounded by the overwhelming influx of questionable information, making it exceedingly difficult to ascertain India's progress in the past eight years. Reliable figures to support any factual claims are hard to come by, leaving the common man disoriented and feeling lost in a maze of obfuscation. 

The media, the fourth pillar of democracy, has regrettably lost all its credibility. BJP spokespersons dominate the news cycle, to the extent they even dictate the line-up of news. Development indices like jobs created, the unemployment rate, inflation going north or south: is the IMF right, or the RBI? These are only a few of the uncertainties in these times of Modi.

The dispensers of news are so caught up in praising Modi that they have no time to ask him the questions they should be asking.

The question is, if Modi doesn’t talk one-on-one to the press, what stops it from reminding him of the misdemeanour every single day? For example, by posting a ‘clock’, updated daily, on the TV screen that keeps track of the number of days Modi hasn’t held a press meet!

Obviously, the number will remain stuck at “zero” because Modi won't be giving an unscripted Press Conference. But that is not the point. The point is, the BJP and Modi and their followers should get to see the “zero” every day of the year, week after week, month after month, year after year.

It will be an “in your face” challenge for Modi, a perpetual reminder that he is afraid to face the press, and why, for what?

The last time an Indian Prime Minister took a Press Conference - [Manmohan Singh's last press conference as India's PM](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/full-text-manmohan-singhs-last-press-conference-as-indias-pm-1320837.html)",1762,113
1cb212b,1713871179.0,Spirited_Abroad9494,Why is hate politics so accepatble in India?,"During a public meeting in Rajasthan, Prime Minister Modi made several controversial statements. Again on tuesday Modi  repeated that congress wants to Give reservation to muslims at cost of SC-ST and OBC Reservation.

*Here are Modi's claims and fact-check of these claims*

**Muslims Bearing More Children:**

* Modi referred to Muslims in India as “those who have a large number of children.”
* However, data shows that the claim that Muslims give birth to more children is **erroneous**. The **fertility rate** of Muslims, along with other religious groups, has been **drastically declining** over the years.
* As of 2019-21 data, the fertility rate of Muslims was **2.36**, which is much closer to the replacement level (average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime).
* [The gap between the fertility levels of Hindu and Muslim women has also reduced significantly in the past two decades1](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece).

**Manmohan Singh’s Statement:**

* Modi claimed that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said (in 2006) that “Muslims had the first claim on the country’s resources.”
* However, this statement was **deliberately misinterpreted**. In reality, Dr. Singh’s statement was aimed at all vulnerable sections of society, including Muslims.
* Dr. Singh emphasized that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, should be empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development. [His focus was on ensuring equal opportunities for all1](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece).

**Congress Manifesto and Wealth Distribution:**

* Modi alleged that the 2024 Congress manifesto proposes to distribute people’s wealth among Muslims if the party is elected to power.
* He combined sections in the manifesto addressing wealth inequality and connected them to Dr. Singh’s speech in 2006.
* [However, this claim lacks factual basis and appears to be a political assertion](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece)

While Modi’s comments have sparked controversy, it’s essential to verify claims using reliable data and context. Dr. [Singh’s emphasis on empowering all vulnerable sections, including Muslims, was not exclusive but aimed at promoting equitable development](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece).

**Now the Question is- Why Hate and fake narratives are so acceptable in Indian Politics?**",540,182
1cpdea2,1715418864.0,Balkans101,Electoral politics is about choosing the lesser evil... And INDIA alliance is exactly that. ,"I reckon there are too many undecided apolitical people who say BJP and Congress are two sides of the same coin. However, the truth is that Congress and the INDIA alliance may be bad, but they are certainly not worse than BJP. Some of the undecided apolitical people may feel alienated by Congress' ""radical"" push for more affirmative action and the caste census, but I don't think it makes Congress akin to BJP. 

BJP engages in blatant communal bigotry. It uses central agencies like the ED to serve political vendetta. The press freedom and academic freedom indices go down almost every year. During the UPA era, the media talked about their scams, but no media criticizes the government now. UP's CM openly orders DMs to investigate any media reports criticizing the government.

As for the caste census, I believe that the Congress Party, which fought the last two elections on milquetoast centrism, felt that it needed an ideology (Mandal) to counter Hindutva politics (Kamandal) . Historically, this was the forte of parties like SP and RJD and not the Congress. In fact, historically Congress and BJP's stances on ""caste politics"" were pretty similar. 

I personally agree with the idea of a socioeconomic caste census as the data revealed by the one conducted in Bihar provides a lot of data to work with. It reveals the massive inequalities in resources. 

However, Congress's aggressive push has also resulted in BJP getting defensive on the issue of affirmative action and getting slightly desperate vis-a-vis reservation. They are now trying to communalize Congress' aggressive push for affirmative action and talk about how Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi opposed reservation. 

The truth is that this is only rhetoric. When it comes to ""caste politics"", even BJP has breached the 50% ceiling in several states, although the Supreme Court stalled it in some cases. In Haryana, after the Jat agitation, the BJP government brought 10% OBC reservation for Jats even though they are a dominant landowning community who own most of the land in the state. In Maharashtra, they brought a 10% quota for Marathas, who are a dominant caste, breaching the 50% ceiling. Centrists who don't like the BJP, but oppose ""caste politics"" must also contend with this. Of course, this is not to say that the opposition didn't support these bills. They also supported the bills for the same reason BJP did. 

I would also like to point out the 10% EWS reservation brought by the BJP also breached the 50% ceiling. The BJP advertised it as the first reservation for general castes. Was it not ""caste politics""??  I mean the definition of EWS is so lax that nearly everyone in the general category is included. (Less than 5% of families earn over 8 LPA, although privileged people like us may think otherwise) 

Even if you think from the perspective of someone who doesn't like ""caste politics"", I think BJP has all the problems that exist in the Congress, apart from communalism and authoritarianism. Congress is clearly the lesser evil. ",414,219

> He gained a second term as a member of the lower house of the Parliament of India in the elections of 2009. Since that time, he has represented the Sultanpur constituency as a member of the INC.

Sidenote:

His personal life is a bit filmy too. He is married the widow of an Indian badminton champion Syed Modi, who was murdered under suspicious circumstances. Sanjay Sinh was chargesheet by the CBI but the case was later dropped. The aftermath is crazy as well:


> Shortly after being released for lack of evidence, Modi's widow, Ameeta, married her long-time lover, Sanjay Singh. This marriage received sensational reportage in the press and became front-page news in India. Sanjay Singh's wife, Garima Singh, read of the wedding in the newspapers and filed a case in court stating that she had never been divorced from her husband and praying that the court declare his second marriage invalid (due to bigamy) and order restitution of her conjugal rights. Investigation revealed that Sanjay Singh had obtained a decree of divorce by stating a wrong address as his wife's residence. He had given the address of one of his several houses for that purpose, although Garima had not lived in that house for many years.

1d8mpvc,1717583656.0,voucherwolves,As a Hindu and consider myself religious who lives in UP and was avid Modi supporter ,"I am just loving the meltdown of casual religious people/modi supporters on Instagram and Reddit and how people are just abusing Uttar Pradesh. 
 
Till yesterday evening I was in favour of NDA govt. until people started trolling UP and especially Ayodhya for BJP loss. This just show that for every BJP bhakt , Ram mandir is just political motive and not something special in spiritual sense. 

There is a narrative going on that “Ayodhya ki janta ne hamesha Raja ko dhoka diya” , “Chanakya kehte hai ki raja agar vikas ki baat kare toh mudhh janta use niche girati hai” . People are talking about Airports and Infrastructure in Ayodhya , Blah Blah. 

These people are disguising as Hindu but actually they are just BJP Bhakts. Not Ram bhakts. 

All these bhakts, I bet haven’t read any of upanishad , or any Bhartiya Darshan Shashtra to begin with and they chant Jai shree Ram like an absolute moron. 

UP definitely showed that that there is a clear difference between being spiritual/or religious vs being Modi Bhakt. 

UP never took Ego of anyone very casually. It created govt and it will topple too. Time after time UP plays important role in changing the course of country. 

Bhakt toh Modi ko hi Ram bana rhe hai which shows how dimwitted these morons are. 

Now that I have realised that BJP is just Gujju-Marwari party who just knows how to do ‘Dhanda’ and I supported them because I was nostalgic about Atal Vajpayee and Others.

&nbsp;

**1) The Modi is nervous trope**. 

Here's Modi being ""nervous"" in 2019. We all know how that went in the end:

+ [Modi's appeal to people to vote shows he is nervous, sensing defeat: Congress](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/news/modis-appeal-to-people-to-vote-shows-he-is-nervous-sensing-defeat-congress/articleshow/69058959.cms)

Much was made of the May 2019 press conference where Modi appeared listless and uncomfortable. Many people saw an election loss in that behaviour. Nothing of the sort happened.

&nbsp;


**2) The poor turnout / anti-incumbency / people-are-tired-of-hate tropes**:

&nbsp;

There are two types of people who make these predictions.

&nbsp;

First type are well-intentioned but overly optimistic liberal / left / progressive types who don't understand the average Hindu mindset and aren't ready to admit that Hindutva understands that shitty mindset perfectly.

They understand booth strategy even less. Due to the FPTP system, just overall vote share isn't everything. Voteshare must be micro-managed and maximized at the booth level, both through legitimate methods and dirty tricks like voter list manipulation. Modi-Shah are masters of it.

I understand the desperation for hope. I experienced it myself back in 2019. I see some people, perhaps new voters of the last 5 years, making the same mistake. Saying things like ""He's sure to lose this time!"" Don't make that mistake. 

Ask yourself a simple question: Do you suddenly see any new ""enlightenment"" or ""critical thinking"" in the masses around you? And does that even happen in a rigid society where there was absolutely no improvement in education, awareness, or quality of opposition?

&nbsp;

Second type who spread these news are centrist / centre-right columnists and editors with hindutva sympathies who are essentially running a psychological gaslighting long con. They create an emotional state of false hope in the liberal groups, and an emotional state of fear in the rightwing groups. Then wait for counting day in anticipation.

On counting day evening, when BJP's victory is inevitably announced, they can then pull the rug of hope from under liberal feet and delight both themselves and their rightwing fans.

After that,  in a week-long orgy of gloating, they'll publish article after article suggesting how and why ""liberals must introspect."" Tavleen Singh is probably already working on this right now.

The gloating BJP SM warriors will pass around these articles, including here on Reddit, along with copious use of the word ""burnol"" in their comments. 

I suspect these psych campaigns are BJP-sponsored at the very least, may be even state-sponsored.

&nbsp;

So I'd suggest not believing optimistic takes and tropes.

The observation is easy to make: Do you see any signs of ""enlightenment"" in the masses around you? I certainly don't. A society, especially a religious conservative immature one like ours, doesn't magically enlighten itself within 5-6 months, that too in the absence of any compelling person or group working to actively bring such an improvement. It won't magically leap from misinformation and hate to ethics and acceptance within months.

IMO, there's no convertible anger against Modi whatsoever. He'll win comfortable majority, maybe even cross the 350 mark by himself. Just prepare yourself mentally for it.",277,41

And last night I was just walking with my friends and we saw Orange flags from Ram Mandir day still on peoples houses and apartment compund. I joking said to my friend who supports BJP that I can only ornage flags and why not Indian flags from Republic day to which he laughed and said Bhagwa flag is Indian flag now and we all laughed moved on. But that got me thinking like does anyone really care about the idea of India as a secular country or a multi religious country. There maybe some people who do care but how many are they compared the population. Even Congress folks don't, I have a friend whose uncle is a Congress nagarsevak and I see him posting Raj Thackeray level shit on his insta everyday and they had a big show on mandir inauguration day. Every Hindu I talk to says India is primarily a Hindu country and should primarily be for Hindus. Christians talk about secularism but in silence enjoy whats happening to Muslims in India and Muslims well I don't know what to say about them this lot is really something else (mai bolunga to vivad ho jayega), they'll want to enjoy secularism only coming from the other side but never ask them to make any effort, every good reform that has been bought has been opposed by them things like triple talaq and shit. Most Muslims in the subcontinent will anyday choose ummah(delusion) over nationality and happily enforce their beliefs over others when given a chance ik not all but most. I think every religion caste has had reformers who have done great work for their own people Hindus themselves spoke against caste system and other evils in Hindu society but Muslims simply never make an effort. But my point being we hear all this fuss about secularism but no one gives a damn about it anywhere in the country. What will happen when a political party let's say BJP decides to let go of the mask and go full this is a Hindu country, they don't have to worry about loosing elections and shit, people would actually cheer for them. I'm not saying that they'll change the constitution or go into dictatorship bc that's not really possible without taking over the military which is literally impossible and states have their own forces as well but happens when they openly say India is a Hindu country and others dont have a place here. No one can really stop them then. What happens when Muslims realise that this so called secularism mask isn't working for them anymore. Something like segregation will start to happen maybe. Idk I maybe over thinking

Note that I haven't included anything about their manifesto because I will give them 2 more years before we see any effect.",431,292
1cbuxc6,1713955141.0,Kitchen-Inflation-73,Political Strategy of BJP and why they are going off-limits,"During Karnataka elections there was a huge anti-incumbency factor. The congress did a great job by raising questions like poverty, employement and kept it grounded. Whereas BJP's main focus was Hindutva. In addition to this, the Congress party highlighted their shortcomings. Even after the backing of Media among other things, Congress was able to win. 

What BJP is trying to do now is to go off-limits. BJP's strategy is to

1) Defame the Congress manifesto
2) Invoke Hindu-Muslim
3) Paint Congress as anti-hindu

Is it going to work?

1) The Hindu-Muslim narrative will backfire a little since most people saw Modi as good guy. Now his mask is off. There are things to say. People who don't care much about Hindu-Muslim is not gonna vote for him now. A percentage of Swing voters mainly. 
As for people who care about Hindu-Muslim, they were already in Team BJP. 


2) Defame the Congress - that's where BJP is hitting their mark

Rural people are the main victims. 
They are trying their best to defame Congress and their manifesto through the mangalsutra narrative and wealth redistribution narrative. 

Nowhere in their manifesto ""wealth redistribution"" is even mentioned. Lmao 😂. In fact, in the interview with Rahul, wealth redistribution word was never mentioned by him. They did mention reducing income disparity etc. 

3) Paint Congress as anti-hindu -
Softcore Hindutva people are going to be influenced by these narrative 

If the Congress is able to clear its image and the image of the manifesto, they will be able to have good chances. People are angry with BJP.

1) Kshatriyas, Jatts, Muslims are not going to vote for BJP amid tensions
2) Farmers are very unlikely to vote for BJP
3) They've already decreased their focus to only hsrd-followes of Hindus
4) Anti-incumbency is a big factor. Nobody except Nehru has been able to come to power for 15 years.
5) Exam leaks, Unemployment. A big percentage of people are angry with BJP
6) They've given much evidence that India is headed towards dictatorship

After the first phase, Modi's strategy has changed. He has become a little desperate and BJP as a whole became very hostile. 

If Congress can make it through there's a high chance they might win.",41,13
8bxj9w,1523606785.0,spooreddit,"I hated Congress, because of their UPA 2 scams. I hate BJP, because I am a human being.","This is going to be a rant, so please bear with me. Prior to 2014 elections, I hated Congress just like most people in India did at that time (I didn't vote for BJP, voted for one of the Dravidian parties). I always knew the change was inevitable because people would obviously be bored of Congress irrespective of what they do and BJP would come to power in 2014. But irrespective of all those alleged scams and corruptions, I never felt anything wrong about India or felt unsafe. I always thought we were democratic and corruption is something that would always happen and could be eradicated with stricter laws. But once BJP had come to power, corruption seemed to be a trivial issue. There's a kind of unsafe atmosphere in India. Right-wing Hindus always play victim games, like how a constant force (the Vatican) is always at work 24/7 to break India and Hindus, while it is the minorities (Muslims and Dalits) who have been persecuted the most after 2014. Tamil Dalit leader Thol.Thirumavalan precisely put out that, if one's offered to choose between corruption and communalism, one should always choose the former and not the latter for there's no guarantee that communalism coated with developmental politics will develop the country. Demonetisation, GST, Aadhar, 15th finance commision, Beef control - everything done in the name of development has only destroyed the country. You could wonder if there was no caste killings or communalism priot to 2014. There were. But the government officials or the self proclaimed nationalists did not defend those activities. Most people now fear these actives could be state sponsored or the state takes no action against them and the attacks are being normalized like they always happen.  BJP has made me, a born Hindu, hate the word Hindu. I am not exactly sure why I am ranting like this or the point of this rant. The thoughts are not even coherent, but spare me I wanted to post them somewhere. I seriously hope fellow Indians make a better decision in 2019. 

TL;DR - Until Congress was in power, I hated Congress. Once BJP has come to power, I kind of started hating fellow Indians and the Indian states that voted BJP to power.",1160,212
16v8qvt,1695985989.0,Infinite_Pattern_466,Why is it that rapes are so common in India compared to countries like Qatar or Saudi Arabia?,"I understand their laws are stricter but it can’t be only reason. I need to know why can’t we do what they are doing? And I am not saying that we keep our women in Burka, etc. because rapes in India are happening NOT because of the women clothing. That argument is a myth.

I think as Indian citizens, it is our responsibility to think of measures to curb this problem at all levels. We can’t be leaving our women to lead their lives in a growingly unsafe society.

Please don’t come with sarcastic responses like “BJP, Modi and Yogi”, etc. Although I seriously believe that these leaders of the BJP don’t consider rape that serious of a crime compared to let’s say cow slaughter but here I am looking for measures to curb rape that are beyond politics and  on a serious note.

I mean why isn’t there a Bajrang Dal type group for women safety in each city of this country. Why are Indians only organised in religious matters but not against crimes like rape?

Edit: Some people are focusing too much on the mention of the two ME countries I mentioned. If you have reasons to believe they are equally bad or worse, it’s okay. I am not focusing on them at all. But there must be some other countries who have found success in reducing rapes or always had low instances of rape. You can talk about those countries and highlight what are they doing to curb rapes and how? Please don’t let the focus of this post shift from the rape problem in India to the situation in the 2 ME countries mentioned. Thanks!",1041,771
178jenx,1697388190.0,Radiant-Mobile5810,Why do so many Indians lack critical thinking?,"This is something I've noticed over the years: many people I have met lack critical thinking. They simply believe whatever is said or thrown at them; they rarely question things or actually use their own 'independent' thoughts on the issue. A similar thing happens in politics, whether it's left or right-wing. I don't see supporters questioning their government's motives. It's not just the case with one party's supporters; it's almost everyone, whether it's AAP, Congress, BJP, etc. They don't question them or their motives; they simply go along with everything. When people ask them why, they justify it by saying, 'Oh, they did great things for our community back then,' or 'You don't know if the opposing party will do even more corrupt things than them.' 

I feel like we easily accept authority; we don't consider ourselves independent thinkers who can think for themselves.",414,131
3s3m54,1447047221.0,spaceythrowaway,Confession: Criticizing BJP/Modi in public scares me [P],"I've fought with multiple people on my Facebook list - people who were friends and acquaintances - because I didn't agree that Modi was the almighty. 

I've seen people become volatile and start question my credentials and my patriotism when I've criticized the BJP in political discussions in public.

I won't even talk about how things are online. Unless you are in a ""safe"" thread where everyone is already bashing Modi/BJP, any word against the party will get you the choicest of abuses.

Now I know the left-wing has its own share of idiots and morons and trolls, but somehow, when the Congress was in power, I never felt that I couldn't say something about MMS or Sonia to anyone - in public, in private or online.

This, to me, is a big, big problem. I should be able to criticize my PM without my entire life history and my patriotism being dragged into it. Nor should I be made to feel like an outcast because I don't agree with the majority opinion.

To people who do this IRL: please understand that scrutinizing elected officials is not just a right, but your duty. Holding them to higher standards is your duty as a citizen. The entire democratic machinery hinges on that.

1cvkcv7,1716110778.0,Julius_seizure_2k23,Thinking about next 5 years if BJP wins is scary and horrifying. ,"
Some of the promises they have made in their manifesto seem like the final blow and nail in the coffin to Indian Democracy.

**1. One nation one election, under the garb of saving costs will deal a deathly blow to our Democracy which is already in ICU.**

>1. Dilution of Regional Issues: State elections often focus on specific regional concerns, and combining them with national elections could overshadow these crucial matters

>2. Reduced Accountability: Longer election cycles may reduce the frequency at which voters can hold governments accountable for their actions, potentially leading to complacency among elected representatives

>>>*1. When elections are staggered and spread across, it atleast keeps the national/multi-state parties on their toes and keeps them somewhat accountable and also allows for other states’ issues/national issues to affect state elections.*

>>>2.*For example : Say a massive farmers protest occurs in Delhi and their ill treatment might influence voting decision of farmers in local states that are going to elections in the following months or a big corruption scandal that got exposed nationally might affect the same party’s prospects in the local elections.*

>>3. The constitutional challenges of ""One Nation One Election"" intensify if a government is dissolved or dismissed prematurely. This scenario raises complex issues regarding synchronizing the terms of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, requiring amendments to Articles 83, 85, 172, 174, and 356 of the Constitution. The need to manage breaks due to dissolution, President's Rule, or hung assemblies poses significant hurdles, potentially undermining India's federal structure. Without proper synchronization and constitutional amendments, the proposal risks facing legal and structural criticisms, impacting the democratic fabric of the country.

2.**UCC**

>1. UCC and Some sections of the new criminal laws are outright anti people and snatch away our freedoms. Like UCC requiring live in relationships registration and requiring scrutiny/consent from a police station guy, maintaining registry, and then after breakup
 
>>2. **Anti-Woman and Anti-Democratic (Anti-Liberty and State interference in personal lives):** The UCC is seen as anti-woman, anti-democratic, and draconian. It restricts adult women's sexual autonomy, allows for moral policing, and interferes in consensual relationships, including marriage and divorce

>3.**Criminalization and Penalties**: The UCC is criticized for its heavy focus on penalties and punishment, creating a legal environment that criminalizes personal choices and relationships.

>4 **Exclusion of Tribes and Targeting Minorities**: Critics highlight the exclusion of Scheduled Tribes (STs) from the UCC and its perceived targeting of Muslims. The law is viewed as a ""Hindu Code"" that imposes cultural values on all citizens, especially minorities

> 5.**Registration of Live-In Relationships**: Mandatory registration of live-in relationships is seen as intrusive, violating individual autonomy, and potentially leading to marital disputes, interference from authorities, and societal scrutiny

>6. **Selective Application and Double Standards:** Critics argue that the UCC's selective application, exemptions for certain communities, and exclusion of tribal and minority groups undermine the law's claim to uniformity and equality

>7. These criticisms collectively paint a picture of a UCC in Uttarakhand that is perceived as regressive, discriminatory, and detrimental to personal freedoms, especially in the context of relationships and breakups.

**And then if BJP wins this time with almost similar results as 2019 and in worst case if it gains more seats, then it reinforces BJP’s mindset , attitude and gives them bold confidence that what they are doing does not matter to people**

3. Manipur does not matter. They can get away with gross incompetence.
   
>1. *In any half decent democracy, this alone would be enough for a president’s rule to be enforced and state govt dismissed and army brought in.*

4.**Protests mean nothing to this govt and are dealt with force.**

>*1. Farmers protest took over a year with 700+ deaths and we all saw how the recent farmer protests were treated almost as an infiltration into the country with nails,spikes, blockages etc*

>2.*Wrestlers protest and nothing happened*

>*3. Ladakh Protest*

>4. Not attending and not even acknowledging the protests and meeting the agitated is basic responsibility of a govt. Whether the demands are reasonable/feasible/logical or not is secondary. If govt believes they are unreasonable then govt should atleast meet them and explain and sort things out.*

5. Extreme Misuse of agencies does not matter.

6. Press freedom does not matter. PM holding an open press conference and being held accountable does not matter. PM coming to the the parliament and answering questions does not matter.

7. Passing bills without any discussion or debate does not matter

8. Suspending MPs for raising their voice does not matter, Mass suspension also does not matter

9. Use of governors to interfere in state govts functioning does not matter

10. Washing machine politics does not matter. People dont care

11. Communalism and Hate speech does not matter

12. Toppling govts doesnt matter

13. Election Commission and its discharge of constitutional duties does not matter

14. Using PMLA and UAPA on civil society activists does not matter

15. Electoral bonds does not matter
16. Covid mishandling does not matter

17. Weakening of democracy does not matter. CAG / RTI is being diluted..

18. Heck, rejecting opposition candidates’ nominations, forcing them to withdraw and win uncontested without even a single vote being cast like it happened in Indore,Surat and In Arunachal Pradesh, 10 BJP MLAs have been declared elected unopposed (they have simultaneous assembly and lok sabha elections)

19. I also have a distant fear that once NRC is brought in and implemented, Muslims might be particularly at the receiving end and a significant number of them might be declared as infiltrators. I dont know why I feel this , but I feel this more so after PM gave a blatant hate speech saying Muslims are those who have more kids and are infiltrators…

20. Delimitation if not done properly will make the south politically irrelevant because UP + Bihar will have equal political influence of that of the entire south.

21. Add above delimitation and the way they undermine Rajya Sabha by bypassing bills by introducing them as money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, further reduces the states political power in the federal structure.

The list is endless and these are some of the major things that come to my mind and are certainly gloomy.

I seriously don’t have energy to fight the whataboutery and falsehoods spread about the INDIA Alliance..

Remember in India politics is not who is good and better than the other but rather who is the lesser evil…and it’s clear who the lesser evil is.

Amazing how People are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure. 

Its highly likely that BJP will return to power for 3rd term on their own. As much as I don’t want BJP to return , I’m starting to lose hope and I’m starting to believe in what Bhakts say , “Ayega toh modi hi” ,

So be mentally prepared (atleast I am)… Good luck and best wishes to all of us. ",1009,306
k8zmt4,1607411175.0,Yashmeet__Singh,Is Narendra Modi led BJP Government gradually becoming a Dictatorship.,"I may get downvoted for this but I feel that this Is becoming the condition. I do not mean exactly a dictatorship but somewhat like that.

If we talk about the Farm Bills and the bills that followed..they were passed (not Farm bills) without any opposition as the opposition was outside protesting against the illegal method of passing Farm Bills. 

Next today the farmers are protesting against the farm bills and people were arrested by Delhi Police inspite of the protest being peaceful. BJP protestors are protesting outside Kejriwal's House...and it is alleged that Police has kept Kejriwal in house arrest.

I am not really interested in Politics..but recently the condition has been worse...What do you think about it.....if you think facts are wrong then please correct.

I recently went to Rome for a holiday and met a group at a coffee place, also all well educated also from the Dheli Region. We shared a coffee and got along well untill they really wanted to talk about politics ......

They asked what I think of India and Modi, in a way which was trying to put words in my mouth. Basically the question was what I tought about the progress the country made the last years etc. 

Although I never wanted to really talk about this topic I was obviously honest and was really critcal of Modi / BJP. Again not to insult any one, but if some one asks me I wont lie.

Basically things got heated and they said I was anti - Indian bla bla, repeating western lies and propaganda.

Is this a normal thing in India, that not worshipping a politician and political party is now considered anti indian, as in the sense Modi = India. This seems like a really disturbing develeopment since India was long famous for a great Press and a great democracy

It is surprising many are not talking about this big elephant in the room. CAA is not just the only problem to deal with. INDIAN JUDICIARY is making a mockery of the constitution. I am listing some of the judgments that I could remember. Please add more in the comments.

1). SOHRABUDDIN CASE

Ex-CJI  Sathasivam who exonerated Amit Shah on his last working day was appointed as governor of Kerala!

2). SAHARA BIRLA DAIRIES

This case directly implicates MODI and many senior leaders of Congress and BJP. In a matured democracy, Modi could have been impeached by now just on this case.

3). DELHI-LG ISSUE

The center-state issue falls under the original jurisdiction of the supreme court. They took 4 years to pass the judgment and it's half baked.

4). RAFALE Deal

Another open and shut case sidelined by lords. Another time Modi could have been impeached if we are even pretending to be a democracy.

7). KASHMIR

Not just about 370 but which other judiciaries in a democratic world allow this govt actions in Kashmir. They literally turned a State into Union Territory overnight without a whimper of disapproval from SC. And they kept on blocking petitions!

8). SANJIV BHAT

Gujrat IPS Officer, a whistleblower of the 2002 riots. Not a fan of his twitter persona but I admire this guy guts. He was jailed for life, apparently, for torturing a man to death. This is a 2-decade old case. First time in the history of Independent India an IPS officer was sent to jail for such a case. My hunch is Saheb didn't like  Sanjiv Bhats Online activism.

qgt8ln,1635329126.0,the_myth69,Discussion between Two BJP Supporters ( Brainwashing of the highest Order),"  Sat Sri Akal JI , Mai ek Bhakt moment report karna chahta huun

So I went to a photocopy shop near my house to get many documents printed for my studies! I was there for quite a while! There were these two old chaps along with me! Both were in their fifties. One of them was a lawyer and the other one was probably his client or friend(idk). 

Initially they were just discussing random stuff and out of a sudden the topic of India and its politics came up and these were their points:  
   
 

1)**About Economy**

The two Uncles hailed Modi for saving the economy and if not for BJP the country would have fallen into Shambles during covid and there would be Riots everywhere much like in USA and people would kill each other for food and money. Then they said that according to stats (trust me bro ones) Indian economy is no1 in the world. Then they went on to say Petrol prices hike is justified and it was the most important way the govt saved Indian economy.

·2)**About Muslims**

Then the two dudes went on to curse Indian Muslims and said they all supported Pakistan and celebrated after Indian defeat in the recent Cricket match.

3) **About Indira Gandhi** 

One among them (the lawyer) said that before Modi there was just one leader who was good and she was Indira Gandhi, the other one disagreed and after some time they both came to the conclusion that Indira Gandhi was not equal to Modi and Modi was greater cause she supported Muslims and had affection with Islam.

4) **About Sonia Gandhi**

This is the one that baffles me the most. They were discussing how Sonia Gandhi Killed Indira Gandhi and Rajeev Gandhi and She did this because she is a CIA Spy, and has come to destroy India and works under China. They said it was not their opinion and it was a FACT!

Then they both went on to again praise BJP and concluded that there is no leader other than Modi in the current political scenario.

They left the shop and I went about my day!

I Cant even imagine how they conclude these theories as facts!",363,108

1cc7pqj,1713988189.0,Spirited_Abroad9494,Why Global Leader Modi turned to hatred and communal Politics?,"The change in tone and the filthy communal hatred filled language used by our Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his recent political speeches didn't came as a surprise to me.

Prime minister Narendra Modi spent a lot in creating image of a global visionary leader, someone who is talking tough to western countries and giving voice to the global south. Many Indians like this image and are under influence of it.

Suddenly, Modi has taken off the cloak and returned to his tested guaranteed formula of communal politics.

If you observe closely, he was not using hate filled and communal language until the first phase voting happened.

The change in his tone has a lot to do about the voting pattern in the first phase. I travelled in western Uttar Pradesh before and during first phase voting.

Let me first tell you what I observed-

1- There was no communal politics on the ground

2- Public seems to be more concerned about their local leaders

3- Caste was most important factor

4- Rajput's expressed discomfort with BJP

5- Turnout of Muslim voters was far High than Hindu voters

Western Uttar Pradesh is stronghold of the BJP. In 2019 BSP-SP alliance managed to win 5 seats here. But this time these parties are fighting separately.

The first phase voting in West UP, if taken as sample, rings alarm for the BJP.

Despite all efforts, BJP is losing several seats here, including their strong hold Muzaffarnagar.

I think, the lower turnout of Hindu voters, no communalization of voters on ground has forced the PM to rework his strategy.

The BJP seems to have realized that only communalism can bring their core supporter Hindu voters to the poll booth.

What do you think?",21,7

18wg7ex,1704168718.0,rishianand,TINA is a Deliberate Propaganda to Hide the Gross Incompetence of the Modi Government.,"**तू इनकी झूठी बात पर ना और ऐतबार कर**  
**के तुझको साँस-साँस का सही हिसाब चाहिए**  
**घिरे हैं हम सवाल से हमें जवाब चाहिए**  
**जवाब-दर-सवाल है के इन्क़लाब चाहिए**

One of the most distinguishable feature of 10 years of Modi Government has been the gross incompetence shown by the regime in every aspect of the administration.

In 2016, Modi announced the **demonetization of banknotes, at a four-hour notice**. The entire nation was thrown into panic. Over 100 people died standing in queues. Everything — from small businesses to everyday life — was thrown into chaos and suffering, while Modi was joking about people's conditions. The Government was so unprepared for the move, that new notes hadn't even been printed yet, and couldn't be dispensed by the ATM. Modi Government kept changing the goals of the demonetization, from action against black money, to curbing terrorism, to bringing cashless economy. Yet, it was clear that the only result of the policy was a massive hit to the national economy and destruction of the informal sector.

In 2017, the Modi Government introduced **GST, riddled with flaws**, its rules were amended dozens of times within a month. Against the objective of uniform taxation, GST introduced five different tax rates, apart from cess. GST dealt a massive blow to federalism.

By 2018, the effects of demonetization and GST visible, and the economic growth slowed down. Meanwhile, the unemployment was rising. Instead of addressing the issue, Modi asked whether selling pakoda in front of news studios and earning ₹200 a day would not count as employment. In 2019, a leaked NSSO report revealed that **unemployment was at a 45-year-high**. The report was suppressed, and further NSSO surveys were stopped.

In 2019, the Pulwama attack happened, where 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Yet, Modi who was shooting Man vs Wild at the time of the attack, continued with his program for hours. Instead of accepting responsibility, he began exploiting the attack to seek votes in the name of national security. It was later revealed that the **Modi Government had received 11 intelligence reports of a possible attack before Pulwama, and refused to provide security to the CRPF despite repeated requests.**

After the 2019 election, the Modi Government went into a hyperdrive with its communal agenda. The Government introduced Citizenship Amendment Act, a provision to grant the Citizenship of India, to non-Muslim illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who entered India before 2014. Which meant, for the first time, the Citizenship of India has been linked to religious identity. Massive protests erupted across India. Meanwhile, the **Government attacked the universities of JMI, JNU and DU** to quell the protests. Peaceful protesters were arrested, while **BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, and Parvesh Verma, openly gave hate speeches**.

In 2020, the COVID pandemic struck, and the **Government imposed a nationwide lockdown at a four-hour notice**. Millions of workers went unemployed. Migrant workers were thrown into an immense suffering, many of them choosing to walk thousands of kilometers rather than suffering from starvation. Thousands of people were killed. With loss of jobs and incomes, millions fell faced hunger and starvation.

In 2020, during the lockdown, the Government conspired with the corporations to **weaken India's environmental laws**, and to allow corporate takeover of dense forests. The Government also conspired to **allow corporate takeover of agriculture**, and force the farmers to become bonded labourers. The farmers fought a historic battle, and after the sacrifice of 800 farmers, the Government was forced to take back the black laws.

In 2020, in the Galwan valley conflict **20 army jawans laid down their lives defending our borders**. Yet, to save his face, Modi claimed that China did not enter Indian territories. The statement was a major setback to India, and contradicted India Army's stand. Reports revealed that India had lost access to 26 out of 65 Patrolling Points in eastern Ladakh, after China occupied over 1000 sq km of Indian territories. China constructed roads and villages inside Indian territories in Arunachal Pradesh, while Modi Government kept awarding massive contracts to Chinese firms.

A few months later, the second wave of COVID struck. Despite warnings, Modi government let India sleepwalk into its largest humanitarian crisis. **47 lakh people died, due to Government's incompetence**. People were suffocating without oxygen, and dying without hospital beds. There was not enough space in crematoriums, and **rivers were overflowing with dead bodies**.

Meanwhile, the Government kept endorsing and protecting hate-mongers. Open call for genocide and rape were made in public rallies. In December 2021, at a **Dharma Sansad organized in Haridwar, speakers gave call for genocide, assassinations, and civil war.**

2022 saw **massive protests against unemployment**. The entire North India erupted in protest after the Government brought the Agnipath scheme. Large-scale riots and arson happened in Bihar, UP and other states. The annoyed youths targeted BJP offices and set them on fire.

2023 witnessed a **massive ethnic conflicts and civil war in Manipur**. Despite having a “double engine” government, the Modi has not even visited the state. He has refused to meet the delegation from Manipur, and has refused to remove the Chief Minister. The state has been burning for seven months.

In December 2023, four youths protesting against unemployment breached the Parliament. Modi refused to address the house on this security incident. Meanwhile, over **140 MPs were suspended from the Parliament**, and crucial laws, threatening civil liberties, were bulldozed without debates. Earlier, in August, the Government passed laws to allow digital surveillance.

Narendra Modi is the most incompetent and useless Prime Minister in the history of India, which is ironic considering how much his propaganda media tries to portray him as a great leader and administrator. Not once does this person ever work, or do what he was elected to do. All his policies and schemes are thoughtless experiments, with no regard for common people.

Why then, one might ask, is there a constant narrative to portray him as a competent administrator, while claiming that the opposition is incompetent. This is the power of propaganda.

Every opposition leader is more competent than Modi. TINA (There Is No Alternative) is a deliberate propaganda created ahead of the General Election. People of India will not fall for it. There are over 1 billion alternatives to Modi.

The Narendra Modi characterised by his emphasis on development, anti-corruption stance, and opposition to dynasty politics that had and continues to plague our opposition space (bar the commies) and now, after 10 years of Modi’s rule, the BJP as well. The version of Modi that focused on economic growth, tackling inflation, modernising the military, enhancing quality of life for its citizens (UPI, VIP vehicles barred), and enhancing India's international standing. The Modi that took corruption head on via DBT and e-Assessments under ITA. The Modi that provided banking services, built toilets, and provided gas connection to our fellow citizens who were hitherto deprived of these services for 70 odd years. The Modi that rose to power without a single mention of polarising issues such as the Ram Mandir, anti-Muslim rhetoric, or Pakistan-centric narratives. The Modi that created an environment of positivity and optimism, the Modi who would herald *Aacche Din*. Modi from the time when his agenda and policies appeared more centrist and focused on governance rather than identity politics.

Not the cult leader Modi of today. Not the one who justifies what *prima facie* appears as blatant extortion scheme/probable money laundering scheme, not after all those tall lectures on corruption. Not the one who seeks votes because of his caste, or his religion. Let the opposition do it, you don’t leverage the same ailments in our republic that you sought to destroy. It was *Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas,* it should remain so. Not the Modi who’s carrying out the world’s grandest social engineering project that seeks to take our country back at least a 100 years. Not the Modi who lies between his teeth’s and stomps upon anyone who dares correct him. Not the Modi who looks aside on tragedies such as Manipur, for over a year, as there are no political dividends to be yielded by intervening. Not the megalomaniac, narcissist who has surrounded himself with sycophants of the highest order whose propensity to derriere licking is obnoxiously nauseating. Not the tunnel vision politician who didn’t even spare his octogenarian mother for PR during Demonetisation, who left her funeral midway so that the limelight of momentous inauguration of the first Vande Bharat in the East would not be hogged by Mamata Banerjee.

This Modi.

I’m as novice as it comes, but imho following the Bihar loss in 2015, and Bengal loss in 2016, Modi was disillusioned. He realised, as, in addition to electoral defeats, he faced further set backs on several schemes such as Make in India and Clean Ganga, that India at large is nowhere near the efficiency levels of an enterprising state such as Gujarat. And Indians do not really vote for progress, but hard and fast cash. Especially TMC sweeping Bengal notwithstanding Sarada and Narada Scams probably drove that point home.

Thereafter, you could observe this change that saw a greater focus on winning elections through strategies that are blatantly divisive and polarising. An entire generation is being raised to hate people who they’re gonna spend their lives in the company of. Dancing outside mosques, pelting stones from ceilings, this is what our youth is procuring their dopamine from. A mockery has been made of our constitutional bodies and individuals. Using ED to harass opposition, co-opting media to a degree that would make Putin blush, using Governors to impede the functioning of opposition ruled states. These precedents are irreversible. Modi won’t be here forever, so in a language that his fanbase understands, “*Khangress might come to power someday, and they will use the same tools to affect their anti-national, anti-hindu agenda.*” Are we prepared? No kidding.

He threw the entire economy into the gutter to win UP elections (ie Demonetisation), he disappeared in the face of the most severe crisis India faced since, idk, partition perhaps? (Covid 2021). Our people were dying like rats, and there was no accountability, no repercussions, no response. He resorts to deflecting blame on men who have been long dead to cover up for his own incompetence even after 10 years of unbridled power. 1 km of 4 lanes is now considered 4 kms, if electricity is provided to 10% households in a particular village, it is deemed that the entire village has been electrified, these are jacking up numbers, these numbers are then being proliferated at pace which can be considered as a form of disinformation especially as there are some nefarious devils in the details. Organised an event that is allocated without any merit, and projected it as being a mega achievement to his gullible followers. And now they want to host COP26 before 2029 elections which would imply they intend to keep Indians dumb and gullible for another 5 years at least.

Polarisation of public and pulverisation of republic (I came up with this and I love it).

Not to imply that there are no positives under Modi. He has delivered on several fronts, most significant of which was national security. Yes there were quite a few terror attacks in his regime as well but let’s not forget the pre-2014 weekly terror attacks. No city, no state was spared or safe.

Where it wasn’t Islamists or Pakistan sponsored terrorists, we had militants. A relative of mine was shot dead in 2009 by HNLC militants for not agreeing to what would be a fifth ransom payment.

Economy was handed the triple shock of Demonetisation, GST and 2019 Union Budget but since then they’ve tempered with it to a controlled degree. Our tax incidence has reduced without damaging our fiscal position (I may be culturally liberal, but fiscally I’m as conservative as they come) and in spite of the plethora of challenges NDA 2 faced (Covid, Ukraine War, Houthi attacks all of which pressurised Brent crude), they are not withering from the targets to consolidate our debts. I appreciate how he’s not backing down against outside intervention in our fragile state of Punjab. There is unprecedented (world class and not just basic) infrastructural development. This and many more, I’ve directly not been a direct beneficiary of anything as such, but he has a 70 odd percent approval rating, I’m assuming those in mainland are getting something at least.

I may criticise Modi all I want but truth be told he possesses the potential to enact transformative change in India and could change the fortunes of the country by his sheer cult of personality. If we could just impose certain costs that would make him focus on prioritising governance over electoral victories and refrain from divisive tactics such as conniving, lying, manipulating, and gas-lighting others to that end, which we know he’s capable of, he very well could go down as India’s Ataturk. Per the status quo, though, he’s gonna go down as the Hindu Zia ul Haq who converted—although scarcely but functionally—a secular India into Hindu Pakistan. Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Its that simple, really.

If we could remind him, who he is, if we could just make him come out of this mega whatever induced trip that he’s on, and realise he will be remembered for longer if he makes us rich than he will be for refurbishing temple arenas, that could and would transform our fortunes. If we could somehow… he will be given the power, he and his team has the vision, enough manpower and with some effort he could get the money as well. If we could just remind him his mode of effective and efficient governance, and not he, was supposed to be the Gujarat Model that India gets, minus the minority stomping and oligarchy appeasement ofc, that’d be great.

Aayega toh Modi hi, toh kyun na pre-2016 Modi ko laye?

Because otherwise, think about it, this inducting members into the party regardless of their character so long as they augur positive electoral outcomes, vociferously targeting super-majority in parliament, stomping on small time politicians which one could construe as a lab rat experiment for bigger things to come, what the they up to?

Whatever that is, if it isn’t what Modi promised in 2014, it portends dangerous, ominous signals. Construe it howsoever you feel like, just remember there are decades when nothing happen, and then there are days when decades happen.",253,283

Sanjiv Bhatt may or may not be innocent, but it is clear that  Modi can stoop to any level to ruthlessly destroy his opponents. Sanjiv Bhatt was sentenced for life in a 30 years old case.

Arundhati Roy

The actions of prime minister Narendra Modi’s government in the past few weeks have shown how many more clampdowns await. Desperately in need of distraction tactics – given the many failures in governance, tackling inflation or delivering jobs – the regime is after a fresh dose of sound and fury against political opponents.

And so a decade-old case has been dusted off, paving the way for initiating legal proceedings against the novelist, journalist and activist Arundhati Roy for comments she made in 2010 about Kashmir. The Kashmiri law professor Sheikh Showkat Hussain has also had charges against him approved. It comes after police raids on the homes of more than 40 journalists in Delhi and elsewhere. They have been slapped with terrorism charges and had their phones and laptops seized. They were working for NewsClick, a **website accused of having funding links with China**: **a charge denied by both the website and its funders.**

The original complaint against Roy is based on comments she made at a conference in New Delhi where she said Kashmir – the region disputed between India and Pakistan – has never been an “integral” part of India. **Shorn of context, these words were used by the right to portray Roy as an “anti-national”.** She has been charged for “offences related to provocative speech and the promotion of enmity between different groups”.

Unleashing the state machinery against Roy shows that the Modi regime has crossed the Rubicon. In millennial speak, no other Indian writer has similar flex on a global level. The legal proceedings set to be launched against Roy are therefore a testing ground. **Once the regime realises that it can go after Roy without a big reaction, it’s open season on all publishers, editors and authors. What’s more, the scourge of self-censorship already tempers any potential criticisms of the state. Fear feeds our silences, but none of this makes headlines. The ripple effect of what will follow the public bullying of Roy is scary.**

It will certainly embolden the **vast troll armies that exist virtually, and their members and supporters who inhabit the streets.** This won’t be just a one-off case – **they will go after anyone who has made the slightest whimper of displeasure against the regime.** **I also fear that the ruling party, the BJP, and its affiliated student groups will take it to the next level.** **The last nine years of the regime has been replete with demands that the work of dissenters be removed from university syllabuses. Educational institutions will become the next contested site for rightwing bullying.** Drawing strength from the action against Roy, they might **disrupt peaceful meetings**. Inspired by this case (and that of opposition politician Rahul Gandhi, who was disqualified from parliament before being reinstated), **underlings of the regime would prove their loyalty and quench their thirst for publicity by using the legal machinery to file cases everywhere against those who criticise the ruling party.**

So why is the government doing this now?

First, against the broader international backdrop of the intensification of the superpower rivalry between US and China, the **Biden administration has made wooing India to its side a key part of its geopolitical strategy. US imperialism needs India as a regional bulwark against China – Modi’s visit to the US in June was pivotal from that perspective. Aware of its indispensability, Modi’s regime knows it can get away with a lot.** In assuming that India has rising geopolitical (and to an extent economic) value for the west, the regime feels more confident to scale up its attacks against domestic political opponents without fearing too much backlash. Perhaps it has overplayed its hand.

Second, facing a groundswell of opposition and criticism across the country on many issues, the BJP does not want to leave anything to chance ahead of next year’s general elections. **Unaffiliated to any political organisation, unafraid when the riot act is read to her, unflinching in her criticism of the corporate cronyism that underwrites the hate-mongering Hindutva political programme – Roy embodies an opposition to everything the BJP stands for.**

Naomi Klein, John Cusack, Yanis Varoufakis – figureheads of the international left, openly addressing Modi on X (formerly known as Twitter), have asked him to keep his hands off Arundhati Roy. I**f the global outcry manages to reach a climax, the world’s unanimous outrage to protect its favourite literary hero might have the side-effect of protecting the dwindling remnants of free speech in Indian democracy.** Within India, too, as an emboldened opposition under Rahul Gandhi seeks to consolidate itself, the attack on Roy might well transform into a national talking point. The ruling party has coined the advertising campaign of India being the “mother of democracy” to showcase itself globally – but the sheer optics of launching this petty attack on Roy might serve the purpose of galvanising public opinion against it.",531,486

And it is up to the leaders of the nation to serve their country's interest even if they have to ""beg, borrow or steal"" and use their diplomatic ingenuity to do so. 

But often a leaders failing really exacerbates the situation. **Modi-G campaigning for Trump in US soil was one such huge and foolish diplomatic blunder - Biden, against whom Modi campaigned in the US is now the President of the US.** 

The result today is a strained relationship between the leaders of the two countries which is also having repercussions on India - apart from denying India the raw material for the vaccines, the Biden administration has also sent a US naval warship to indian maritime economic zone, which is a minor move in military diplomacy to remind Indians of their place in international politics.

Even if an indian politician doesn't know anything about international diplomacy, all a PM has to do is listen to the Indian Foreign Service and stick to the conventions and protocols established by past governments. India actually has a very competent foreign service and that is why we have a good standing and reputation in the international community. Modi-G failed when he thought he knew better.

**India is quite lucky that Biden is a more rational man than Trump or Modi.** Imagine if Modi had campaigned for Biden, and Trump had won? He would have lashed out even more openly, irrationally and aggressively against Modi and India! 

This is why the opposition had rebuked Modi-G:

> ""Mr Prime Minister, you have violated the time-honoured principle of Indian foreign policy of not interfering in the domestic elections of another country. Our relationship with the United States of America has throughout been bipartisan, vis-a-vis Republicans and Democrats,"" Mr Sharma wrote, adding, ""Your actively campaigning for Trump is a breach of both India and America as sovereign nations and democracies"".

This foolishness was noticed by the international media too:

**Why is the Biden government being so indifferent, bordering on hostile, with India? PM Modi and his thoughtless politics.**

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that nobody likes foreigners interfering in their elections process. And US politics has always particularly been about undermining your opponent. Unfortunately Modi-G made himself an opponent of Biden when he chose to openly and publicly campaign for Trump in US soil. Biden is also a right-leaning politician and their ilk don't take kindly to this. 

But Modi-G's actions had deeper repercussion when his ~~bhakth~~ right-wing ideological supporters further embarrassed India by waving indian flags when the Trump supporters were rioting in Washington:

> India’s national flag being waved outside the US Capitol in Washington D.C. drew immediate attention. This seemed to be the only flag of a foreign country carried by the mob of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol Bulding, meeting place of the US Congress.

> While some condemned the misuse of the national flag in the course of rioting in a foreign country, there was not much surprise. **The Overseas Friends of the BJP had openly supported Donald Trump’s bid to be re-elected** and the Indian Prime Minister had famously endorsed the bid by calling for 'Ab Ki Baar Trump Sarkar' at the Howdy Modi rally at Houston in 2019.

**US being a country of immigrants is very sensitive to such actions, because if immigrants don't integrate successfully, and involve in politics being influenced by politicians of their origin country, it endangers the security of America.** 

This foolishness of Modi-G will now take a lot of effort to undo, as the US administration will now continue to view India and a section of indian immigrants suspiciously too, due to this breach of trust and diplomatic norms between the two country. 

*(Note that this isn't any kind of excuse made for both the US and Indian leadership - the Biden administration is being too selfish with their foreign policy as a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in India and elsewhere, while PM Narendra Modi is squarely responsible and shares ALL the blame for the huge COVID crisis that India is today facing.)*",351,107

It's like a hunter traps it's prey from all directions until the prey finally has nowhere to go but to stay where it is and wait for the hunter to come. Same way, today A citizen from one end of country is not able to get the news from other end or states without filtration by these politicians. News channels donot cover queries of certain groups as much as they cover cricket, celebrities, weddings of rich people, ceremonies attended by our dear PM and one sided debates of BJP spokespersons. I don't find Indian media providing equal representaion to opposition parties. I also fear the current government which should not be the case in a democracy. There are people who blindlessly believe in what bjp does is for the good for the country. But the country is because of the people and if even a certain part of the population is facing problems, it should be represented and a solution should be brought out by the government. Instead, what I feel happening is that they are not represented. The mizoram case, farmer protest, Sonam Wangchuk's demands we know nothing about them...

1cn0qvv,1715162157.0,rishianand,Rahul Gandhi And Fighting A Political Battle On One's Own Terms,"On 22 January 2024, as Prime Minister set out for Ram Mandir Consecration, the ruling party used entire state, media, and political apparatus to turn the religious even into a political campaign. His propaganda media hailed it as a ""renaissance"", a ""historic day"", a beginning of Ram Rashtra. The Union Government Cabinet hailed it as a true freedom, undermining the long fought freedom of 1947. The propaganda media was particularly scathing in its attacks on Congress for turning down the invitation.

At the same time, Rahul Gandhi was travelling across the country meeting lakhs of common people in his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. The Yatra was also heavily derided by many. Yet, the former Congress President stayed on his course, refusing to follow the communal politics and raising the issues of livelihood and justice.

Nyay or Justice became the watchword of the two Yatras that spanned the length and breadth of the India. Throughout the Yatras, Rahul Gandhi continued to meet thousands of Youths, Workers, Farmers, and the marginalised classes.

At the same time, Congress was hit by a series of defections, dwindling funds, and immense pressure from a media which had declared the elections a foregone conclusion, and the politics of Hindutva an undeniable fact. Yet, Congress refused to tow their agenda.

In April, Congress unveiled its Election Manifesto with a focus on Youth, Women, Workers, Farmers, and the Backward Classes. For a nation reeling under crises of unemployment, inequality, and injustice, Congress' pro-people plank was a breath of fresh air.

Unsurprisingly, in his patented style, Modi went on a communal diatribe to call Congress Manifesto as a Muslim League Manifesto. He went from rallies to rallies, alleging that Congress wants to steal women's mangalsutra, wealth, buffaloes, etc. He claimed that Congress wanted to destroy Ram Mandir. Fearing a possibility of defeat, the ruling party went further into a communal hatemongering campaign.

Yet, with Congress refusing to join its chorus, BJP stands alone and adrift. Following Congress' campaign against assault on constitution and social justice, BJP itself was forced on the backfoot. With Modi's recent comments against Adani and Ambani, one thing is certain, Rahul Gandhi has managed to force Narendra Modi to play on his terms. India has, for the time being, been saved from the political agenda of Hindutva.",77,5

**Farmers**

On December 28, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organization of farmer's unions, which successfully led the historic farmer's movement, gave a call for nationwide awareness movement to expose the anti-farmer policies of the Modi Government. The movement will involve district level campaigns between January 10 and January 20. On 26 January, Samyukta Kisan Morcha will observe Republic Day with district level tractor parades. Further large-scale programs are being planned for the next few months.

**Workers**

On December 7, the Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions, which represents crores of workers from organized and unorganized sectors, called for a countrywide mobilization of workers, which will culminate in a massive mobilization by February 10. SKM and CTU had organized a three-day sit-in protest on 26-27-28 November 2023, which witnessed a historic display of solidarity between farmers and workers.

**People's Movements**

For the first time in nearly five decades, the civil society organizations, people's movements, and prominent activists from across India have united with a resolve to expose and oust the anti-people regime of the Modi Government. The initiative had begun on 9 August 2022, marking the 80th anniversary of Quit India Movement. Further programs were developed, leading to a nationwide coordination, working together for the first time after the Emergency.

**Youths**

Various unemployment campaigns are planned in the upcoming weeks to highlight the unemployment crisis in India. Unemployment is one of the crucial issues ahead of the 2024 election.

North India has a large youth population suffering from massive unemployment. The youth are disillusioned and angered by the policies of the Modi Government. Their ire turned into arson when the agitators targeted the BJP offices during Agnipath protests. The recent security incident in Parliament is another reminder of the crisis unfolding in India.

**Bharat Nyay Yatra**

On December 27, Congress announced the Bharat Nyay Yatra, which was in development since the conclusion of highly successful Bharat Jodo Yatra. The Bharat Nyay Yatra will begin from Manipur on January 14, travelling 6200 km across 14 states, to reach Mumbai on March 20. The Yatra, which will focus on the issues of unemployment and inflation, as well as social and economic justice, comes at the crucial moment ahead of the 2024 General Election.

The BJP intends to fight the 2024 election on the issue of Ram Mandir. The party is trying to use its communal agenda to influence the voters in North India. Congress' Bharat Nyay Yatra can provide an effective counter to BJPs communal agenda in this region.

Congress' Bharat Nyay Yatra is a brilliant move that can change the narrative of the 2024 General Election. The experience of Bharat Jodo Yatra shows that such a movement can help bring the issues of the common people into popular discourse. Even the mainstream media is unable to ignore such a movement. Bharat Jodo Yatra received overwhelming support from the common people, and stands as a testimony to the fact that BJP's narrative can be successfully countered.

**Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance**

On 18 July 2023, several major political parties came together to announce the formation of an alliance against the BJP-led NDA. Soon as the alliance was formed, the BJP went into a hyperdrive to discredit the bloc. While any large alliance will face certain challenges, India is not new to alliance governments. In many ways, a more equal alliance has provided better leadership and more democratic governments.

In 2019, BJP had a vote-share of less than 38%. The formation of INDIA will ensure that there will be one-on-one contest between INDIA and NDA, and may seal the fate of Modi Government. This simple arithmetic had led to the Congress' defeat in the 1977 elections.

INDIA alliance has a better leadership against the gross incompetence of the Modi Government. It has a more diverse leadership, which can ensure the survival of federalism. It can arrest the decline of democracy in India.

2024 Election is a DO OR DIE moment for Indian democracy. And we are prepared for this LAST STAND FOR THE REPUBLIC. We will not let the sacrifices of our freedom fighters go in vain.

In previous thread, I showed how it affected your everyday life. In this thread I will list out the actors who caused this. The criminals who must never be forgiven. Even the dead ones.

**The Anonymous Architect:**

Sorry to disappoint for no name here, but this really is the crazy part. The idea of Electoral Bond most probably came from an outside force. How do we know this, refer to this huffpost article: [https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/rbi-warned-electoral-bonds-arun-jaitley-black-money-modi-government\_in\_5dcbde68e4b0d43931ccd200](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/rbi-warned-electoral-bonds-arun-jaitley-black-money-modi-government_in_5dcbde68e4b0d43931ccd200) It shows the first iteration that government introduced for the electoral bonds. 

https://preview.redd.it/2ftalcqfd9jc1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=620dd97493520eb417aea7b33bde4079e73ca447

The funny thing about this document is, it is undated, unsigned, and printed on a plain sheet of paper bearing no letterhead. No Indian Bureaucracy Memo looks like this. It means it came from outside power. Maybe some shitty policy pusher, or maybe some asshole Industrialist who wanted to introduce this secrecy.   


The first paragraph itself says ""“A bearer bond is one that does not carry name of any particular  beneficiary and title belongs to the holder of the bond. Exchange of  hands in such bonds leaves no trail.” which means the people behind this, right from the beginning had no motivation of improving transparency in Indian democracy.

**Arun Jaitley - The Facilitator:**  
Arun Jaitley has always been one of the biggest crook India has ever witnessed. And obviously as the finance minister during these times, he has also sinned with this crime. And as finance minister, he was also the one who introduced these bonds. Surprisingly, RBI was against the idea of these bonds. But then another crook from his team, **Hasmukh Adhia,** still pushed the file for this law by saying the stupidest statement ever. ""This advice has come quite late at a time when the Finance Bill is  already printed.” Adhia wrote, despite the RBI responding on the first  working day after it was asked for comment. “We may, therefore, go ahead  with our proposal.” **Tapan Ray** was also involved.

\*\*\*On a side note, Hasmukh Adhia the Finance Secretary during Jaitley's term, is not an economist. He has PhD in YOGA. Yeah I am not joking.\*\*\* 

**Pon Radhakrishnan - The Liar**  
In the winter session of Parliament in 2018, Rajya Sabha Member Mohammad Nadimul Haque asked the government a simple question: Had the Election Commission of India raised concerns about electoral bonds?

The then minister of state for finance, P. Radhakrishnan, replied that the government had not received “any concerns from Election Commission on the issue of Electoral Bearer Bonds”.  

THAT WAS A LIE. 

And EC had surprisingly given many objections against the bonds: [https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/electoral-bonds-narendra-modi-election-commission-opposition-arun-jaitley\_in\_5dce3cd1e4b01f982eff5c62?utm\_hp\_ref=in-paisapolitics](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/electoral-bonds-narendra-modi-election-commission-opposition-arun-jaitley_in_5dce3cd1e4b01f982eff5c62?utm_hp_ref=in-paisapolitics)

But the finance ministry simply pretended it had never heard from the Commission.

And then three senior bureaucrats came up with six different convoluted  explanations to protect then-Minister of State P. Radhakrishnan when he  was caught lying about electoral bonds. One of the bureaucrats in this coverup was **Subhash Chandra Garg**, 

\*\*\* Fun note about Pon Radhakrishnan. He is one of the most corrupt politicians in the south. he spoke of chasing away christians from his district. He also was involved in removing about 50000 fishermen from the electoral list to avoid them from voting to the other side. He still lost that election though, LOL. \*\*\*

**The PMO creates loopholes for the rules they made:**

There was 15 day deadline for redeeming these bonds. Mogli-ji and his cronies came up with these rules. 

Rule:

""the bonds would be sold by SBI only 4 times a year (with a provision  for 30 additional days in general election years) and would have to be  redeemed within 15 days of the date of purchase."" 

2018 had no general elections. Guess what happens. just ahead of the Karnataka assembly elections in May 2018, as *HuffPost India* has previously reported, Prime Minister Modi’s Office [asked for an unscheduled 10-day window](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/electoral-bonds-modi-illegal-sale-state-elections_in_5dce6b7ee4b01f982effa205) from May 1 to May 10, when anonymous donors could buy bonds to donate funds.

The expired bonds were to be donated to the relief fund. To avoid that, and get that money back into BJP's pockets. **Vijay Kumar**, deputy director in the economic affairs was involved

The Finance Ministry violated a vital anti-money laundering rule by allowing anonymous donors to donate expired electoral bonds worth Rs 10 crore to an unidentified political party, or parties, soon after the May 2018 Karnataka state elections resulted in a hung assembly.

\*\*\* You remember what happened during the 2018 Karnataka Elections right, who was the one responsible to do money exchange to gain majority\*\*\*

**Narendra Modi - The Ringmaster:**

He is the a\*\*hole who brought this shitty idea in and ruined everything for Indian Democracy. Nuff said.

&#x200B;

BJP received 50% plus of the funding from these bonds meanwhile Congress received 9%. 

This is going to take us to the one party system where the opposition will have no voice. YOU have no voice. 

These crooks need to be stopped.

jp19i0,1604649838.0,goldenGhostBanri,How RSS/BJP has infiltrated into US Politics,"Disclaimer : All the information I am posting is from public domain. I have provided sources below this post. I am only providing information about the people in US government and especially from Democratic party who are backed by RSS-BJP lobby. @Admins if this is still going against the rules, let me know. I will modify the post.

The post is to list and show RSS-BJP lobby is trying to push their candidates deep into the US government and how they have infiltrated into their political scenario.

Raja Krishnamoorthi : Got elected to Congress from District 8, Illinois. Shared stage with World Hindu Congress in 2018 with Mohan Bhagwat[1]. He is also the guy who is funded by people with close ties to Narendra Modi like Bharat Barai[2]. Bharat Barai donated thousands of dollars to Raja Krishnamoorthis campaigns[3]. Raja Krishnamoorthi also shared stage with Modi at howdy Modi. He was one of the only few politicians of Indian-origin who attended Howdy Modi. Most of them declined to attend it.

Sri Preston Kulkarni : Lost the seat in Texas 22nd District even after being heavily and blatantly funded by RSS[5]. Same sources claim he is nephew of a BJP politician but it is most probably not true. Heavily funded by the Hindu American PAC and also by Bhutada family who is closely linked with BJP/RSS[6] and HAPAC. Sri Preston Kulkarni also tried to claim being unaware of what RSS is even after having years of Foreign service background. A key donor to his campaign as seen in the [6] is Ramesh Bhutada, the national vice president of the U.S. wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh[8]. 

Tulsi Gabbard : She represents Hawaii and she is not of Indian Origin but has huge backing of Hindutva crew. She has attended conferences of VHP. Rishi Bhutada of [6] and Ram Madhav of BJP were invited to her wedding. She was part of the presidential race in Democratic party but dropped out early and withdrew from US House re-elections.

As Joe Bidan is about to be elected as President of USA, it is important to note that all of the above candidates belong to Democratic party. A party that claims to be liberal and progressive. Joe Bidan has/had appointed Amit Jani an avid supporter of the Modi regime, as his Asian American and Pacific Islanders Outreach (AAPI) Director and Muslim Outreach Coordinator[9]. He is son of Suresh Jani, one of the founders of OFBJP[10]   

There is another candidate from Republican Party, Manga Anantatmula. She lost by 40 points in Virginia. In her words, Modi is “Best Thing That Ever Happened to India”[11]. 
 
Some other candidates of Indian origin were also elected into the Congress who do are not part of the above group and who have been critical of Modi government and oppose fascist ideology of RSS. This includes Ro Khanna from California., Kamala Haris from California, Pramila Jaypal from Washington. There is also Ami Bera who got elected from California as well. He received contributions from the same people as the other RSS backed candidates but I am unaware about where he stands politically on these issues. Someone knowledgeable should comment on this person. I can write more about these candidates if someone is interested. 

Why am I writing all of this? To provide more clarity about how much RSS-BJP has infiltrated into US politics.
Why this can be important? In next 4 years, these are the people who are going to dictate US policy towards India.

1cj0z4i,1714714159.0,rishianand,"One Year of Violence in Manipur: BJP is not only responsible for the failure to contain violence, but also for creating the conflict","On 3 May 2023, ethnic violence broke out in Manipur between the tribal minority (Kuki-Zo) and non-tribal majority (Meitei) communities. Over the following months, the conflict escalated, while the state and Union Government kept the pretence of normalcy. Meanwhile, rather than trying to defuse the tension, the Chief Minister N Biren Singh, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, tried to portray the Kuki-Zo community as terrorists and infiltrators.

On 19 July, a video went viral which showed two Kuki women being assaulted and paraded naked by a mob. The incident had taken place on 4 May. Yet the police took no action for 75 days, until the Supreme Court took cognizance of the matter after a public outcry. According to CBI chargesheet, the women had sought refuge in a police station, yet they were driven away and handed to the mob. Moreover, even the National Commission of Women had been apprised of the case on 12 June, yet they took no action. The incident sparked outrage across the nation. Meanwhile, CM Biren Singh shamelessly tried to downplay the horrific incident, claiming that hundreds of such incidents have taken place. 

Over the following months, the situation turned into a civil war. Let alone visiting the state and trying to assuage the people, Prime Minister refused to even speak about the crisis. When he was forced to do so, he trivialized the crisis by senselessly comparing it to the opposition-ruled states.

Meanwhile, journalists, fact-finding teams, and even opposition leaders were prevented by the state government from reporting about the crisis. When a team of National Federation of Indian Women reported on the grim situation in the relief camps and held CM responsible for the conflict, the state government charged them “under penal provisions for conspiracy to wage war against the Government of India, assaulting President/Governor with the intent of compelling them to exercise a power, making statements prejudicial to national integration, defamation and promoting enmity among two groups and inciting riots.” The state police registered an FIR against Editor's Guild of India for their report. The Government also prevented Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from meeting the people. The prolonged internet shutdown further prevented any news from getting out. 

The situation in Manipur is so tense, that even police officers are being kidnapped. The Government has often been in conflict with the Army.

A report by Assam Rifles directly blamed the Chief Minister for the inflaming the conflict. Even the BJP legislators from the state have held the CM responsible. Yet, the double-engine government of BJP has refused to remove the CM, and allowed the violence to go on.

Yet, despite the failure to contain the violence, or the hatemongering which escalated the violence, or the police and the NCW not acting on the complaints of sexual violence, or the suppression of news, or the Prime Minister not visiting the state even once, the most shocking and disdainful incident was Narendra Modi's claim that the timely intervention by the Centre saved the state.

2011: politically naive, had no interest

2012-13: disturbed by corruption charges and supported anti incumbency

2013-14: followed politics and the spectrum and coalgate scams, vehement critic of iNC. 

2015: did like the Swacch Bharat and ujjwala schemes. Pahal too. Had an eye on AAP, about whom I had mixed views

Started becoming suspicious with dadri lynchings. I was naive to believe the jumla of SZ Irani on JNU. However the days of blind belief were gone

2016: was in bank, seen the menaces of Demonetisation. Also, the lynchings started reaching record levels. Their anti intellectualism, shambolic cronyism and supporting bigoted fringe elements meant no longer I supported their views. I never harbored those views actually

2017: the more the jumla, the more I started hating BJP. The more jumla, the more they started grappling on to fringe elements to survive. Calling for Privatization of banks, nirav modi case, i could see what the government actually stood for. Blame nehru as much u want, but without his vision India doesn't have SAIL, IIT, IIM, AIIMS, ISRO etc. I also hated their attempts to privatise education. Privatization of education would mean market fee fixation (and the amount of capital reqd would keep it an oligopoly), which would mean the poor and the middle class would not have the money to join the premier institutes. One might argue education loans, but I believe that's a worse bet to confining the intellectual growth of a student. He is forced to take up such stuff or work that allow him monetary gains, also remains the problem of availing loans
Was a vehement critic of nmc, when it included the bridge course. In the name of disciplining everyone, they started placing sanghi stooges and I also came to know about  the fake video JNU issue and the Henant karkare murder case

2018: kathua case was a fullstop. I had never seen my dharma going so violent, and people flaying bhagwa flags to support the perpetrators. After that PoCA, CBI, Rafale happened, and now I see they are a much bigger poison that happened to this country. It wasn't BJP or their market mania, but the biggest problem was and is the Sangh, that has hardly anything to do with development, and has everything to do with spreading hate, bigotry and evil.",317,361

Not everything that you don't like is against the interest of the nation.Stop treating everyone who speak against you as your enemies.

You scrapped reservations to Muslims who are less likely to vote for you, and gave quotas to Marathas. How is this not fucking appeasement policy that you accuse Congress of? Do you seriously think that we won't notice your hypocrisy?

The country will move on from hating Congress to looking towards you with cynicism in no time. You are in the spotlight. Modi can do only so much. What's good in having an excellent engine with flat tires.  It is imperative that you lay the path and improve the way India does politics.

e1yy9u,1574779904.0,jasonj2232,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?","After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",832,123

1corv1g,1715353823.0,Balkans101,Sensationalization of Sam Pitroda's remarks,"I normally don't watch any TV news channels. However, I ended up watching some news at a relative's place, coincidentally on the fateful day that Mr. Pitroda made the aforesaid problematic remarks. 
Now, while the remarks were indeed problematic and the Congress Party rightly distanced itself from the remarks almost immediately, the TV media had a field day, portraying it as part of some sinister Congress conspiracy to divide the country, as part of some wider international cabal, even though anyone with basic comprehension skills would realize what it is -- a bad analogy to describe the (phenotypic) diversity of the country and something akin to the cliched childhood speeches about unity in diversity. 
What struck me about the biased TV coverage was that his remarks were never shown in full. Instead, they had something like ""Dakshin Bhartiya Afriki: Sam Pitroda"" in a large font on the screen at all times. Anyone who tried to piece up a story after reading all this would think he is trying to divide the country(like my BJP supporting relatives 
who said that Sam Pitroda meant that India cannot stay together as a nation) 

The analogies he uses are problematic and inaccurate since there is great phenotypic heterogeneity within the four regions as well However, the broader point he was trying to make was nowhere as bad as the response it elicited. For instance, the PM said that he felt ""insulted"" and brought up President Draupadi Murmu out of the blue. He literally said that he now knows why Congress tried to defeat her (Ngl, this feels more racist than the Sam Pitroda remark)

>At the rally in Warangal, Modi referred to Pitroda as an American uncle. “I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of shehzada and just like the third umpire in cricket, this shehzada takes advice from the third umpire. This philosophical uncle said that those who have black skin are from Africa. This means that you are abusing several people of the country on the basis of their skin colour,” he added.

""African"" is neither an abuse nor did he say that those who have black skin are from Africa. But, the way Modi related it to Draupadi Murmu without anyone raising even an eyebrow (considering the hue and cry over Sam Pitroda who is not even in actual politics) -- it just feels insulting and frankly racist. 

Much has been made of a remark made by a political nobody while BJP leaders including the PM continue to make even more disparaging remarks, including in response to Pitroda. ",189,56

While everyone was writing the obituary of the Congress, I remember reading an article that pointed out that there were around 30+ by-polls elections scheduled, and these would indicate the trend for 2019, as these were spread all over India. The interesting thing is that the BJP has been at the losing ends of these by-polls, and have had a tough time even retaining seats they won last time. And this is all over India. 

True, the beneficiary has not been only the Congress, but they continue to be the principle opposition to the *Sanghis* and have increased their strength in the Lok Sabha (still their lowest though) at the expense of the BJP.

**I wrote this post specifically to counter the regular propaganda of the BJP that Modi and BJP will rule India till 2024.** He is neither invincible nor smart. 

And the Congress is a 100+ year old party. Experience always trumps amateurishness, bravado and bullshit in indian politics. 

Politically ignorant people forget that winning and losing is part and parcel of a democracy. While the BJP does deserve credit where credit is due for their victory in coming to power in 2014, don't fall victim to the hype - they are yet to even achieve the heights that the Congress has (like winning the amount of parliament seats that it has, winning consecutive terms, and ofcourse, their record on governance ... ).

In fact Modi has been an incredibly lucky PM - oil prices have been the lowest when he won (and yet he wasted away that opportunity), he only governed on an auto-pilot mode not really having to think hard on policies as the Congress plans ahead and the UPA had already drafted policies for the next 10 years (and even continues to do so, even while in opposition, as experience has taught them), no opposition within his organization etc. 

And yet what a waste of an opportunity - apart from renaming old schemes of the Congress, inaugrating already inaugrated projects, travelling the world at government expense just for PR and crony capitalism, coming up with hair brained policies like Demonetisation and their own flawed version of the GST, and worst of all - not following the blueprint of the UPA vision (especially in defence - if he hadn't damaged our ties with Russia and followed up on fifth generation fighter joint project with them, if the Rafale scam with Reliance hadn't happened, and he had just followed the UPA policy, India would have been fully self-sufficient in building fighter planes in the next 20 years), destroying the hard work of the UPA government in bringing peace to J&K -  **Mr. Narendra Modi is the definitely the worst PM India has ever elected**.

However, I believe that when it comes to the understanding of international politics, they are no better than a 15 year old kid. Heres why:

&#x200B;

1. Modi fucked up the vaccine rollout strategy just because he wanted to position India as an empathetic powerhouse. He intentionally slowed down our domestic rollout so that he could export vaccines to smaller countries and generate good PR. He assumed that India will not experience a 2nd wave, and also forgot the basic tenet of diplomacy 101 -  ***The weak appreciate gestures of empathy and generosity only from those who are in a position of strength.*** Now, India has been reduced to a laughing stock globally by trying to take care of the world without putting their own house in order.
2. The RW supporters are crying hoarse over Biden's refusal to remove restriction on vaccine components and also release unused vaccines over to India. However, they forget the fact that Modi actually tried his best to ensure that Biden loses by organizing political rallies for Trump. That was another strategic miscalculation which has backfired now. US' increased hostility towards the current Indian government is apparent by the actions of their navy, and their decision to term India as a currency manipulator. Also, BJP IT cell's strategy of targeting Meena Harris was another blunder which the VP isnt going to ignore
3. During the last couple of years, India has let its relationship with its closest ally Russia stagnate, deteriorated its relationship with US by betting on the wrong horse Trump, and aggravated its relationship with the strongest country in the world (arguably) China on economic and military front. All of this is a result of a delusional belief that India is an economic powerhouse which deserves to be seen on equal footing with countries like US and China. 

I am sure that there are more instances which can be added to the list. However, what is undeniably true is the fact that the world will not take us seriously and in a positive light as long as the current government is in-charge",650,86

Edit 2: I appealed YouTube takedown and the video is back up!

Hello everyone,

WION is extremely popular outside of India in a number of western countries, my own included. The channel is rising in popularity among non-Indian westerners, and I'd like to know what people in /r/India think of WION as well as its editor-in-chief, Sudhir Chaudary.

I ask because I recently posted [this tweet/video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQzDmqJu-XI) of Sudhir Chaudhary praising former Senior Counsellor to the Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, as well as Bannon showering WION and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi with praise.

As a foreigner who is far more familiar with US politics than Indian politics, this video struck me as rather bizarre. In my experience with speaking to Indians who live in western countries but watch WION and the show ""*Gravitas""* regularly, they seem utterly convinced that it is the most unbiased source of news on the air in India and abroad. These viewers of WION are usually of wealthy, right-wing backgrounds and are adamant supporters of BJP as well as PM Narendra Modi. They also tended to be older adults (50+ years old).

In my experience speaking to younger Indian adults (20-45 years old) in western countries about WION, most people I spoke to rolled their eyes at the mention of WION and compared to to America's FOX News-- some even compared it to Newsmax, and even further right-wing news outlet.

I've spoken to a number of people I know who live in India about this, but I'd like to ask a larger group of people from India what their perspective is on Sudhir Chaudhary, WION, and Steve Bannon.

1bb2jsf,1710048341.0,rishianand,Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind Par Wo Kahan Hai? An Important Appeal,"Friends, **today our nation stands at a crossroads.** Unemployment, price rise, economic inequality, and corruption are at their peak. Attacks on Dalits, Adivasis, minorities and women are on a rise. Our nation is being thrown into the fire of communalism and hate for the political gains.

**Unemployment has become a national calamity.** The Modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. Permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. Regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. In 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. Today, the youth unemployment in India stands at 40%, while more than 30 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant. Through the Agnipath scheme, the government has compromised the national security and the future of the youth. Youths who demand employment are being violently repressed.

**Government has pushed the farmers and workers in a terrible tragedy.** Rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. Public sector units are being privatized. The government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. Agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide. In 2020, when the nation was under lockdown, the Government passed the anti-farmer laws in a conspiracy with the capitalists. In a struggle against this, 750 farmers lost their lives. Meanwhile, a violent persecution and propaganda against the farmers continues to this day.

**Economic inequality is at its peak.** The poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. In the last three years, while the nation was reeling under COVID pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in India increased from 102 to 169. Allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. At the same time, domestic savings have fallen to its lowest level in five decades. Social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. The price of essential household items, including oil and gas, have risen sharply. Meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the Global Hunger Index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet.

In the last 10 years, **there has been an unprecedented rise in hatred and violence** against Dalits, tribals, minorities and women. The Modi government has sheltered rapists in spite of widespread protests. BJP leaders have publicly made hate speeches and called for violence. BJP-led governments have encouraged, sponsored, and protected the rioters. Our religious festivals have been taken over by a political mob.

Affirmative action policies are being weakened. **Dalits, backward classes, and women are being deprived of their constitutional right to social justice.** Forest Law has been amended to facilitate corporate takeover of forests and drive the adivasis off their lands. Overriding environmental concerns and objections raised by environmentalists and scientists, the Government has pursued disastrous projects which has caused irreparable damage to the environment and the human life.

The BJP government has launched an assault against universities and academic institutions. Scientific and historical facts are being replaced with propaganda and falsehood. Government has openly promoted unscientific and irrational ideas. **Health and education budget have been slashed.**

**There has been an unprecedented assault on democracy and the Constitution.** Mainstream media has become the megaphone of the Government. Independent journalists are being persecuted. Any kind of protest or dissent is crushed with force. Fundamental rights are being trampled. Institutions like CBI, ED, Income Tax have been turned into a political weapon. The autonomy of the judiciary and the Election Commission is under a threat. Parliament has been turned into a rubber stamp of the Executive. Federalism is being weakened with interference and attacks against the state governments.

In 2016, the Modi government announced demonetization of banknotes with a four-hour notice. More than 100 people died in this man-made disaster. Everything, from small businesses to everyday life, was thrown into despair. During the COVID pandemic, without any regard for the common people, the government imposed nationwide lockdown at a four-hour notice. Lakhs of workers lost their livelihood and crores of people had to face starvation. Migrant workers had to walk thousands of kilometres on foot. **47 lakh people died of COVID due to the government's indifference.** Lakhs of people died without oxygen and hospital beds. Due to a lack of space in crematoriums, rivers began overflowing with dead bodies.

Generating 2 crore employment opportunities every year, making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024, building 100 smart cities by 2023, doubling the farmer's income by 2022, creating 10 crore new jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022, bringing back the black money in 100 days, **every promise turned out to be a jumla.** Meanwhile, BJP received secret donations of over ₹6,500 crore through electoral bonds. Manipur is in a state of civil war. China has occupied thousands of square kilometres of Ladakh, and built roads and villages within the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh.

To hide these failures, the Modi government is using religion as its refuge. Festivals and faith are being politicized. The public is being misled by spending crores of rupees on publicity. The reality of hunger, poverty, inflation, and unemployment is being hidden behind the curtain with an endless propaganda of ’Acche Din’ and ’Amrit Kaal’. **Instead of guaranteeing fair price to the farmers, employment to youth, security to women, social justice to backward classes, education, health, and prosperity to the citizens, and unity and brotherhood for the nation, the ruling party is talking about “Modi ki Guarantee”.** At the same time, efforts are being made to amend the Constitution and replace the democratic republic with an authoritarian state. A concerted attack on the values of our freedom struggle is underway.

Friends, **today our country is facing an unprecedented crisis.** The freedom, achieved through countless sacrifices and a long struggle, whose values are enshrined in our Constitution, is under a threat. The nation envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, is under a planned assault.

The 2024 Lok Sabha election is the most important election in our nation's history. It is not merely an election between two coalitions. It is an election for our nation's destiny, for the values of our freedom struggle, for the survival of our democratic republic, for a new struggle and nation building. 2024 Lok Sabha elections is a “Do or Die” moment for our country. **It is our historic responsibility to reject the anti-people politics of BJP and ensure a crushing defeat of the Modi government in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.** Let us, we, the people of India, unite in this historic struggle and defeat the anti-people Modi government.",203,155

AP/TS - Mixed response. I am from Hyderabad, I have seen a lot of polarization tactics in last few months and have seen it working too but lets see what happens, so far I don't see overwhelming support for anyone 


Chhattisgarh - In Chhattisgarh, I got to know that Rahul Gandhi's 8000 rupees/month for all women has reached tribal area and most likely women will vote for him while men are voting for Modi 

There has been a lot of politics regarding reservation % in this area, that'd be a factor too 


Madhya Pradesh - Satna is going for Congress or BSP because the candidate of both parties are popular however sentiments have been pretty Anti-Modi in the region 

One guy I spoke to said that we don't have any option, People vote for BJP in Madhya Pradesh that's why we have to vote too but there should be an option.

I spoke to a family which always votes for BJP, they were Pro BJP but were complaining about people not going to polling station to vote 



Delhi-Haryana - People in Haryana are firmly with INDI alliance, they were pretty vocal about their hate for BJP 

Mixed response from Delhi 


Maharashtra - I have spoken to a lot of people from Maharashtra and mixed response here too. People supporting BJP are as aggressive as people opposing BJP 




My observation - 


1 Women voter which were primary vote bank of BJP might vote for Congress in some regions 


2 SC/ST voters are voting for INDI alliance 


3 There's no Modi wave, there are people who love him and treat him like a Messiah but things have changed considerably 

4 BJP will not be able to form government without NDA alliance and maybe they'll need more help 

5 If women and ST/SC voters shift to INDI alliance then there's a possibility that INDI alliance will get as many seats as NDA got in 2019

Why're we not discussing this? These incidents have happened in a matter of week. It's truly depressing how BJP controls media and everything that reaches the general population. If opposition can't do enough now, why are they even the opposition? I feel like they are trolling the whole country since 2014 by only sending police/military to places.",1055,148
1at6of6,1708189492.0,Stuart_bloom,BJP is the new Congres,"BJP is the new congress. This is not concerning though. The rather alarming thing is that there won't be a credible opposition.

BJP is adding leaders from other parties left, right and centre nowadays. However, the party won't be able to accomodate all the leaders without some friction. The primary USP of BJP has always been the discipline and it's cadre. But as they welcome other older leaders set in their ways, it would be difficult for the party to discipline them. Then you have to satisfy every leader's ego as well. This is bound to disillusion and demoralise the existing cadre, who are working on the ground.

The addition of leaders is going to create multiple power centres in states and ultimately at the federal level as well. Every leader tries to further their personal cause. They launch their children and their relatives at regional level to have it all in the family.

Today, there is one power centre in the BJP. Narendra Modi is irreplaceable in terms of his mass appeal. There can be other more efficient or visionary leaders. But you can't find another person with his aura and command over the masses. Not Yogi not Gadkari. He has achieved his stature rightfully as he delivered an astounding verdict. I understand that poor performance of INC and scams also had a much larger role, but these things won't ever take credit away from Namo in one's memory. Now, once Namo is gone from the centre then the BJP high command's grip over this mixed cadre is also going to get loosened.

I also believe that Namo has set an extremely bad example for running the country. There is no accountability over burning domestic issues and unfortunately no communication from our supreme leader.  Congress for all its fault gave space to all the ideologies. That's how BJP rose, had Congress employed the same methods BJP is employing, not much would have been left of it. Now, whosever is gonna get to the centre is going to use the Namo playbook and that won't bode well for the country.",24,15
1cz7ejg,1716508419.0,mzt_101,Prashant Kishore is more than what he seems on the surface…,"With another recent Karan Thapar's ""jal lijiye"" moment, pk is being trolled left and right, for which he should be honestly. He lost his cool in a pretty cringe way, and even though I believe that Karan was purposefully baiting him throughout the interview to re-emphasize the same point about BJP winning majority and questioning his confidence and credibility. PK should have the grace to handle a man like Karan as he has done numerous times in previous interviews with Karan. 



As for the ""prediction"" shown on the screen of Prashant tweet was exaggerated as his tweet said. 


*“I’ve been repeatedly asked to comment on the outcome of #UdaipurChintanShivir In my view, it failed to achieve anything meaningful other than prolonging the status-quo and giving some time to the #Congress leadership, at least till the impending electoral rout in Gujarat and HP!”*


He is telling his opinion about the impact of Congress status-quo leadership though #UdaipurChintanShivir which was in Rajasthan, and will result only in “electoral rout” in Gujrat and HP, Congress lost Gujrat which Karan didn’t highlight, and pk didn’t gave any numbers like he gave in West Bengal 2021 and for BJP 2024, also, INC won HP with 1% greater vote, so the margin was very close (INC=44.2% & BJP=43.2%).


Also, I didn’t find pk’s prediction for BRS Telangana anywhere as Karan mentioned. Still, pk was technically wrong and should’ve handled it better.


##So why I am making this post? Because I noticed people weren’t only trolling him for losing his cool, but people were labelling him a BJP agent and sent by BJP and what not.


If you look at PK’s history, He is the most anti-BJP person you can find, because he may not have criticised them as an influencer on their optics, but he has run against BJP in every election after he ran Modi’s campaign in 2012 & 2014, when asked why he left, he said PM was not interested of his proposals to introduce lateral entry in political post, as he claimed most revolution in India has been possible by bringing people of speciality into the cabinet be it, Green revolution, telecom revolution etc.



He made JDU win Bihar **defeating BJP** in 2015

He made Congress win Punjab **defeating BJP/AAP** in 2017

He **lost Congress** in UP against BJP in 2017 (his only lost)

He made YCP win Andhra **against TDP/BJP** in 2019

He made AAP win Delhi **against BJP** in 2020

He made TMC win Bengal **against BJP** in 2021

He made Stalin win Tamil Nadu against AIADMK in 2019



Now, you can say its business and he is doing it to earn money, how such a money driven person be a good person? And you may be right, he is doing it for himself, whatever his personal reasons be, but he is definitely not cosy to BJP.


Hell, he even pointed the 4 pillars of BJP’s dominance are **Hindutva, Nationalism, Welfare & organisational force**. If Congress can challenge them or give a counter to even 3 of these, BJP will lose. He said that Modi is BJP’s Star, but also their biggest weakness.


Because even though people vote Modi in Lok Sabha, **Modi’s ability to garner voter on this name for regional Vidhan Sabha is declining rapidly since 2019**. So, people are not voting BJP in Vidhan Sabha on Modi’s name only anymore.


He also said Brand Modi is declining as well, because even *their supporters are not mesmerized by him anymore, they will vote for him this time, but only because they think there’s no alternative.*


He also said the level of resistance against BJP will rise in the 3rd term, because **BJP is ignoring the rural distress, unemployment & economic issues**  by the poor people as their income is not increased in this tenure.


Tell me any other BJP agent who has the balls or clarity to say this about BJP.




##He was one of the most vocal critics of CAA-NRC

When he joined JD(U) after 2017, under Nitish Kumar, which later alliance with BJP, he resisted, as he was against BJP’s tactics of doing work after 2014, but he stayed for time because he wanted to develop Bihar, He had three goals in mind.


1.  Thousands of *youths* should enter politics, as the median age of Lok Sabha has been increasing and increasing, he wanted to train young people who wanted some guidance and help them understand the nitty gritty of it.

2.  He wanted *lateral entry* of experts in positions which require it. So that we can get more innovative and creative ways to grow our sectors, he gave examples of the green revolution, telecom revolution, etc.


3.  There should be *decentralisation of power.* From centre to state and state to local. He believes right now, resources are controlled too much by the people above and although it would take years, it still is a necessity.


**Now to CAA-NRC**, He was very vocal that even though CAA maybe alright, NRC will create a divide in society based on religion that shouldn’t exist in our country. He made multiple tweets begging non-BJP states to reject this bill.


He shouted in interviews that BJP can’t strongarm non-BJP states, if they decided to reject it, he was confident that Bihar will never accept it.


But Nitish Kumar voted for it the Parliament, this made PK leave JDU, as he was wholly disappointed with Nitish and his decision.



##What’s his ideology, what he believes in then?

If you scour his interviews, whenever he has been asked this question, he says that he is a believer of Gandhi. He quotes him frequently and has a banner of it on his twitter profile ""The best politics is the right action”.


His ideology lies with the Congress, centre left. He believes in the wisdom of crowds, that people are smart enough and will tell you what they want, if you listen to them carefully without thinking they are poor hence lack intelligence. **He believes India will always have an Opposition as only 38% Hindus voted for the BJP, hence 62% people are still not satisfied with the Hindutva narrative, so half Hindus still not believe Modi’s appeal, implying Hope for the future of this country.** Even though Democratic values have taken a hit under Modi as had under Indira, he believes no single person can steamroll a population of 1.4 billion, unless they have more than 55% of the voter share.


He was a public heath care manager working for UN in Chad, (I know), Africa. For 10 years before his election journey, so he already has plenty of experience in public intervention and data analysis. In fact, he met Modi for a paper he wrote on the child malnutrition epidemic in Gujrat.




##Now, why us liberals felt so strongly about his remarks on BJP?

Since the beginning of this year, we were certain that BJP is winning with a clear majority, even though INDIA had some fuel, we were pretty sure who’ll win. But some things happen that changed the wave, electoral bonds put BJP on the back foot for the first time, even though only narratively. We started believing that maybe it’ll help, then ED arrested Kejriwal, this was also very bad for BJP. So, we saw aha, then low voter turnout, Modi’s Mangal sutra, ECI’s sleepiness, Dhruv Rathee’s explosive series unmasking all the propaganda, and positive feedback from the culture were taken as a at least we are winning culturally, so every mishap by BJP we thought, yes it’ll decrease votes or increase INDIA’s chances, this was 
our resistance.


 but we made a mistake.


We assumed that if INDIA won culturally, it WIILL transform electorally, but the reality is, **it takes months to reach the masses and that’s what Prashant Kishore exposed.** He himself said Modi’s Brand is decreasing, but it won’t really matter electorally as its too little too late.


So, when he said it publicly it felt like all our efforts to resist the dictatorship were in vain. That’s why we started questioning his intentions & motives, as he isn’t criticizing BJP’s horrendous politics, but rather beating an already dead horse like the opposition, which needs are support. That’s what caused pain, I was also depressed, but deep down I think he’s right.



Because he is not saying these things after Electoral Bonds or Kejriwal arrest or low voter turnout to build BJP’s momentum. He has been saying this for the last three months, since January. He maybe wrong or right, but his assessment is consistent, hence worthy to consider. And we liberals should at least, take his word seriously, as he is not just another mouthpiece for ‘saheb’, but one on the finest minds to enter politics in our time. 

My 2 cents.

I didn’t even mention his Jan suraaj moment, where he is doing pad yatra for the last 2 years in every village of Bihar and preaching the values of “vote for the future of your child nor Caste”, “Vote of education” and self-governance. He claims to take Bihar from the least developed state to the Top 10 in the next 10 years.",10,13

1ub4s3,1388754804.0,brien23,Is AAP really offering something better than BJP?,"Some say,

>Let's not forget that AAP is indeed a big elephant in the room at the moment. And the traditional policies are still talking in the same old tune and concepts of communal lines and historical instances of judgement. 

Some reply,

>AAP is nothing but a *big bunch of petulant flimflammers*, promoted by the malicious, anti-Modi Media. Do your research; don't be swayed by the unnecessary hype.

Hence I call for a discussion. We all know why AAP has gained the popularity in recent times. But I don't think it is necessarily a good development and it is because of the following apprehensions:
 
 1.	**Skulduggery**: AAP made lofty, impragmatic and somewhat *unattainable* promises but didn’t get into cumbersome details; they kept it deliberately vague on how these promises would be kept. For example: The AAP spuriously promised to give 700 litres of free water to the poor. And according to Media reports, they delivered. All good then, right? But NO! THEY DID NOT DELIVER. They only gave it to metered houses not the poorest people in the slums who actually are in the need of that water. Besides, it, although subsidized, should not be free. There will be lack of motivation to save if it seems unrestricted even if it is only to a certain level. So it’s better for them to stay vague, and the argument stays emotional. Get specific, and there’s a rational argument. The AAP could lose both the argument and the votes. More on that below.

 2.	**Opposition to nuclear energy**. At a time when earth's survival is at stake and its resources are steadily shrinking and India luckily has 25-30% of the world's total thorium reserves (1,160 thousand tonnes), we now know that the AAP is OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR POWER IN GENERAL, how *cool* is that?^See ^[this](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-29/india/45674389_1_kudankulam-nuclear-power-project-aap-movement-against-nuclear-energy) ^and ^[this](http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Bhushan-Assures-AAPs-Support-to-Agitation-Against-Nuke-Plant/2013/12/29/article1971627.ece?pageNumber=1&parentId=142539&operation=comment) They also oppose Kudankulam project in specific. India has a vision of becoming a world leader in nuclear power technology due to its expertise in fast reactors and thorium nuclear fuel cycle. Nuclear Energy can be nothing short of a BOON, a dream-come-true FOR A COUNTRY like India. Say goodbye to that Vision. Not even a month in power, they are already looking to “APPEASE”^[[1]](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/aap-to-support-nuclear-plant-stir-says-bhushan/1213139/) instead of thinking rationally? ([AAP wooing Muslims](http://muslimmirror.com/eng/aaps-fresh-bid-to-woo-muslims/)) Sounds similar to another party?

 3.	Their **flawed economic** model is the biggest problem.[[a](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-02/news/45799265_1_power-tariffs-aam-aadmi-party-aap)], [[b](http://www.firstpost.com/economy/between-the-state-and-markets-aaps-inherent-and-tragic-design-flaw-1319449.html)] Like I said before, their arguments are based more on emotional consideration than judicious thinking. The trickery behind their much touted instant delivery of poll promises is another matter of grave concern. Abusing subsidies is the easiest trick in the book. That doesn’t solve the fundamental problem which is “deficit”. Remember Islamic Hajj subsidy by congress? Now in contrast to Congress rule, they might look like shining star but we need more. Much more. Like Hardeep puri said, 
 >""Governance has to be based on understanding and sound considerations. If you are going to base concessions on subsidies, then you should know what it means. Subsidy by definition is a charge on the State exchequer. The State exchequer gets money from the taxpayer. So you are going to take the tax payers’ money and you are going to give subsidies to a limited section of the people. I want the AAP experiment to succeed but it cannot succeed on the basis of wasteful subsidies. [...] you can never build infrastructure on the basis of subsidies. Infrastructure and utilities like water and electricity, by definition, have to be PAID FOR. If you are giving subsidies on the supply of water and electricity, then you are obviously ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL."" ([Full interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/in-un-there-were-times-i-wished-india-had-a-stronger-govt/20140103.htm))

 Kejriwal’s only option was to develop *effective policy* and programme frameworks that reflect a balance between the state and the markets. This is the only realistic approach. However, Kejriwal have not yet opted for this synthesis and unless he does so, he cannot *really* deliver on the promises he has made to people. The new chief minister of Delhi is **thus caught between the rock and a hard place**. In Latin America, the combination of socialism and populism has been a bane.

 4.	With US troops pulling out from Afghanistan thus leaving the region vulnerable to the threat of **re-talibanization**, along with *Chinese and Pakistani Armies* intruding Indian Territory *in tandem*, what Mr. Kejriwal CAN ENSURE is merely ""CLEAN"" GOVERNANCE BUT what WE NEED right now is beyond the capacity of Kejriwal, and that is a **MUSCULAR, nationalist** Government led by a solid, time-tested administrator who has the gumption to do what is needed and QUICKLY so. 

 5.	India needs **rapid growth** and **pragmatic policies.** *Modi indeed has gained the confidence* of business heads of countless nations like UK, Australia, Japan, Canada, etc. This is what Kejriwal does not and **will not have** in the next decade at least. Sadly for Kejriwal, we don’t have that much time. AAP, like congress, is a left-leaning party but we need the exact opposite a right-leaning party like BJP.

 6.	**Lack of credibility**. I would like to venture a guess that AAP, knowingly or not, is acting as a mask for congress, or rather a disguise! I think it is safe to say that Congress knows very well they cannot fight BJP using traditional means like hyperbole based on hollow claims and false promises, so they have created a unique army of veiled soldiers, AAP. They are looking to survive as a parasite sucking the resources out of AAP. That is the only way to ensure the perpetuation of the party and to *postpone* the **incarceration** of prominent congress leaders (including Congress chairperson madam Sonia). In 2004 elections they also used the phrase “aam admi” in their slogan — so this ploy is not at all new to congress. They know how to strike an emotional chord with gullible fools by making downright impractical promises only to be ensued by premeditated half-hearted attempts to fulfil those once they get power. But, just like in today’s Delhi, the poorest of the lot would be the biggest loser. AAP’s true colours came out when they accepted Congress’s support on Delhi despite the illustrious charade comprised of prevarications and avowals of their neutral repugnance towards the idea of getting into alliance with either the BJP or Congress. The fact is that both AAP and Cong are left-leaning parties. Although this may sound perilously close to a conspiracy theory there is more than a kernel of truth in it. There is probably collusion between CON and AAP top.([Congress using AAP to stop Narendra Modi](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-30/news/45711507_1_aap-nitin-gadkari-delhi-lokpal))

 7.	**Lack of Vision**. I don’t think it needs to be expanded on any more than it already has been. BJP has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like *Subramanian Swamy*, a veteran economist whose contribution to Indian economic reform is *unquestionable*, legal experience of *Arun Jaitley*, *Ram Jethmalani*, sheer political experience and proficiency of *L. K. Advani, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj*, career diplomat like *Hardeep Puri* whose expertise in international diplomacy might just prove to be invaluable and, of course, administrator like *Mr. Modi*. What more can a nation want? And the best part is that all of them at least have a *vision* of how Indian republic should function and they are presenting it cogently and forthrightly. AAP doesn’t have a history yet and their track record is not indicative of any radically different point of view from that of the Congress when it comes to National security, energy, curbing *communal voices* and India’s rise, as a whole, in the community of nations. 

So I say let the AAP prove its worth by concentrating on Delhi for the next few years, solve its regional problems first. Let them explain their stance on such critical issues mentioned above and only after that can we really extrapolate the effects of AAP getting involved in the task of federal governance. Until such a time, voting for them in a general election will remain an unnecessary risk which is likely to cause more problems than it may solve.

I think there is much more.

Needless to say these are all my opinion based on my limited knowledge, please feel free to engage in a constructive discussion and avoid bringing in extraneous subjects. Thanks!

**UPDATE:**

 [After Manmohan singh, AAP exerts Narendra Modi will be dangerous for nation](http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/after-pm-aap-exerts-narendra-modi-will-be-dangerous-for-nation_901267.html) - seems like AAP and CONG are already dancing in the same rhythm and AAP didn't waste much time before getting busy with age-old typical congress tactic - anti-campaigning.

**Some of the other problems:**

**The minority appeasement**. Meeting with [*Tauqueer Raza*](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-aap-leader-arvind-kejriwal-s-meet-with-muslim-cleric-maulana-tauqeer-raza-khan-ahead-of-assembly-elections-strikes-controversy-1914147) and then going on to defend him. AAP is doing the same things that Congress did. Indian society, I think, doesn't need any more of that.

**Their supercilious and self-righteous attitude**, they *just don't accept* that there are good non-corrupt people in all parties. Lots of people from Congress and BJP joined AAP and suddenly became non-corrupt while they were corrupt in their old parties.

By the way, I don't *hate* AAP for their crusade against Corruption, that is good. I believe their ideology and attitude are to the **sheer detriment of Indian economy and society at large**. I would even vote if there was an option of AAP-like party with right leaning economic ideology (some might say *BJP is that party* and quite rightly so).

Transparency:

Despite strong claims about transparency, *why* did the AAP try to muzzle the media *recently*?

**What I want you to answer:**
-------
Except for their infinite faith and ability to simply presume *good*, what do the AAP-supporters base their support on? *That* is my question! 

**In the long run, what can AAP give that the Congress didn't and couldn't?** How on earth is AAP different from Congress under the sun *today*? Same old *minority appeasement, same-old subsidy tricks, same old attacks on Narendra Modi*. Seems like AAP is the mirror image of Conrgess only under different guise.

Is there any explanation at all apart from Kejriwal's meaningless harangues on how ***everyone***, and no if - no but, *everyone* is just *CORRUPT*? 

**If they are so freaking corrupt why the heck are AAPians not putting them in jail instead of taking their *help*? This is what I want to understand.**

1816klo,1700650809.0,basil_elton,US thwarted plot to kill Sikh separatist on American soil,"


US authorities thwarted a conspiracy to assassinate a Sikh separatist on American soil and issued a warning to India’s government over concerns it was involved in the plot, according to multiple people familiar with the case.

The target of the plot was Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American and Canadian citizen who is general counsel for Sikhs for Justice, a US-based group that is part of a movement pushing for an independent Sikh state called “Khalistan”. 

The people familiar with the case, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence that prompted the warning, did not say whether the protest to New Delhi led the plotters to abandon their plan, or whether the FBI intervened and foiled a scheme already in motion.

The US informed some allies about the plot following the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh separatist killed in Vancouver in June. In September, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” linking New Delhi to Nijjar’s fatal shooting.

The US justice department is debating whether to unseal the indictment and make the allegations public or wait until Canada finishes its investigation into Nijjar’s murder. Further complicating the case, one person charged in the indictment is believed to have left the US, according to people familiar with the proceedings.

The US justice department and FBI declined to comment. The National Security Council said the US does “not comment on ongoing law enforcement matters or private diplomatic discussions with our partners” but added: “Upholding the safety and security of US citizens is paramount”.

Washington shared details of the Pannun case with a wider group of allies after Trudeau went public with details of the Vancouver killing, the combination of which sparked concern among allies about a possible pattern of behaviour.

India has rejected Canada’s claims about New Delhi’s possible involvement in Nijjar’s murder as “absurd”.

One person familiar with the situation said the US protest was issued after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a high-profile state visit to Washington in June.

Separate from the diplomatic warning, US federal prosecutors have filed a sealed indictment against at least one alleged perpetrator of the plot in a New York district court, according to people familiar with the case.

Modi’s office referred questions about the case to India’s external affairs ministry, which declined to comment.

Contacted by the Financial Times, Pannun declined to say whether US authorities had warned him about the plot, saying he would “let the US government respond to the issue of threats to my life on American soil from the Indian operatives”.

“The threat to an American citizen on American soil is a challenge to America’s sovereignty, and I trust that the Biden administration is more than capable to handle any such challenge,” Pannun told the FT.

Pannun angered Indian officials this month by issuing a video in which he warned Sikhs not to fly on Air India because it would be “life threatening”. He told the FT he was not making a violent threat against the airline.

Washington has urged India to help the Canadian investigation, but has avoided being too critical of New Delhi in public over the Vancouver case. The Biden administration views India — a member of the Quad security group along with Japan and Australia — as a critical part of a broader strategy to counter China.

Several people familiar with the debate inside the Biden administration said officials were aware that any public disclosure of the US plot, and Washington’s protest to New Delhi, would renew questions about India’s reliability as a trusted partner.

The Biden administration has faced criticism from human rights groups for its efforts to deepen relations with India.

India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party is a Hindu nationalist party, and Modi has been accused by his political opponents and human rights groups of fomenting violence against religious and ethnic minorities in India.

The Indian prime minister was feted this summer in Washington, where he delivered a speech to Congress.

This is a reflection on my upbringing, political journey, and hopes for India's future.

I have never felt my upbringing was overtly religious, despite participating in pujas and temple visits. I have always attended private schools and earned a Bachelor's degree from a college in Delhi named after my religion. I have never felt afraid for my life because of my religion.

My first encounter with politics was during the 2004 Elections when I was old enough to read but too young to understand. My parents were jubilant at the Congress's surprise victory, which sparked my curiosity. This led me to read newspapers and search online about politics and its key players. My civics textbook also introduced me to democracy and political movements, which I saw firsthand with the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party from the Anna Hazare/Lokpal Bill protests.

Between 2004 and 2014, I learned about Narendra Modi, a controversial figure. My curiosity led me to research the Babri Masjid, Ayodhya, and the Godhra Riots of 2002. I remember watching these events on TV without understanding them fully. By 2013, I had decided to vote for anyone but Modi in the 2014 National Elections. I couldn't understand how anyone could support him after reading about the riots and the BJP's temple obsession. My vocal stance led to conflicts with my extended family, but I remained steadfast in my beliefs.

Living in Mumbai during the 2007 siege was terrifying. By 2013, my political stance became more defined. I faced backlash for my views and relationship with a Muslim girlfriend, but I didn't see Muslims as a threat or Modi as a savior. My diverse friendships, including one with an RSS Pracharak, helped me see different perspectives.

After my first vote in 2014 didn't yield the desired outcome, I felt dejected but hopeful. By 2019, I saw Modi as our own Frank Underwood, using fear and nationalism to retain power. The COVID-19 crisis revealed the government's incompetence, leading to a psychotic episode where Modi and Amit Shah became villains in my mind. This period involved intense anger, medication, and recovery.

Over the last two years, I hoped for the end of the current regime. Seeing Modi's emotional moment yesterday felt like a personal victory, restoring my faith in our democracy. I am proud to be an Indian, cherishing our diverse conversations and shared heritage.",104,8

This is the question being asked around everywhere. 

We are not a 2 party system like US. We have more than 2600 registered political parties out of which 8 are national parties. 

Before Manmohan singh most of the voters might not even have heard his name. So it's not your responsibility to decide who would be your supreme leader. 

You should vote for the right candidate in your local area so that you can hold him accountable when time comes. No supreme leader would come to your constituency to improve your situation.

It's a facade that major parties like BJP has created a god like image of Narendra modi where he is projected as someone who would pull us out of all misery into a ever rising super power. After 7 years of his rule, we are in deep trouble across-the-board.

Even if the government in the center is not a full majority and is made up of coalition. It would get us stronger opposition. Strong Opposition holds the ruling government accountable and prevents un-democartic laws like CAA-NRC, Farms bills to be passed easily. 

At this moment I would do anything to get my basic freedom back. To live in peace and harmony. To have scientific rigour in place than drooling over our past and promoting un-scientific methods. 

To have forward looking policies even with slow progress than hastily implemented backward looking policies which hurts our economy.

Edit: Many people commented their dissatisfaction from BJP and wish to rule them out anyhow. If it was not clear from my post earlier, I also intend to vote out BJP at any cost. After excluding BJP, we should try to vote for the right candidate locally and not vote for any worthless candidate of a major Non-BJP party.",638,110

However, one of my friends is ethnically from Pakistan (parents emigrated), and he will go on giant rants about Modi, the BJP, and how they treat muslims in India. He's gone so far as to say that the United States should recognize the BJP as a terrorist organization, they are comparable to the Third Reich of Germany, and he has many other colorful opinions. Also worth mentioning is that he supports Imran Khan of Pakistan (he called him the Bernie Sanders of Pakistan), hates Donald Trump, and hates Tusli Gabbard because she supports Modi and the BJP.  


So... I want some additional perspectives. I know Modi is a controversial figure, and my friend has looked into this more than I have.

Here's the link: 

http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile

It's very long but here are the portions that stuck out to me:

* **His role in the 2002 riots**:

That same night, Ehsan Jafri, a 72-year-old former MP for Ahmedabad, called his granddaughter Anika in Surat with some disappointing news. Ensconced in his home in Gulburg Society, a mostly Muslim upper-middle class neighbourhood in Ahmedabad, Jafri, a veteran Congress politician, already sensed it would be risky to attempt a journey to Surat the next day. On the phone, he told Anika he wouldn’t be able to come. “But it’s just a shutdown, and he should make it,” she protested to her mother.

At around noon on 28 February, Anika called her grandfather again. “Have you not started?” she asked him. “Beta, the situation is not good here,” Jafri answered. “There are mobs everywhere.” He told her he needed to put the phone down, since he had a lot of calls to make.

A huge mob had already gathered around Gulburg Society, armed with petrol bombs, cycle chains and swords, shouting slogans like “Take revenge and slaughter the Muslims.” Many of Jafri’s neighbours, as well as Muslims from neighbouring slums, had come to his house seeking safety, expecting that his status as a former member of Parliament would afford them protection. “He must have made over a hundred phone calls for help,” Jafri’s wife, Zakia, told me. He called the Gujarat director-general of police, the Ahmedabad police commissioner, the state chief secretary and dozens of others, pleading for their intercession. A witness who survived the carnage later told a court that Jafri even called Narendra Modi: “When I asked him what Modi said, [Jafri] said there was no question of help, instead he got abuses.” Word of Jafri’s frantic calls for help even reached Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani in Delhi: a BJP insider close to Modi, who was with Advani on 28 February, told me that the BJP leader had even called Modi’s office himself to ask about Jafri.

By 2:30 pm, the mobs had broken through the gates of the housing society, and a flood of men converged on Jafri’s home. Women were raped and then burned alive; men were made to shout “Jai Shri Ram”, and then cut to pieces; children were not spared. According to records later submitted in court, Jafri was stripped and paraded naked before the attackers cut off his fingers and legs and dragged his body into a burning pyre. The official police report indicates that 59 people were murdered in Gulburg Society, though independent inquiries put the number at 69 or 70. Jafri’s wife, Zakia, and a few others who had locked themselves in an upstairs room survived.

To this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.

“His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”

“Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.

“I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”


* **His interactions with businessmen**

Modi was joined on stage by the heads of two venerable business families, Jamshyd Godrej and Rahul Bajaj, as well as the director-general of the CII, Tarun Das. If Modi expected a friendly welcome from Godrej and Bajaj, he did not get it. After recounting an incident from the previous month in Mumbai, when an Oxford University professor had heckled Modi at a public event meant to celebrate his election, Godrej called on Modi to use the mandate from his victory to ensure the safety and security of all Gujaratis.

Bajaj was even more outspoken: he began by declaring that 2002 had been a “lost year” for Gujarat. Looking at Modi, he asked, “Why don’t we get investment in Kashmir, the Northeast, or Uttar Pradesh and Bihar? It is not just the lack of infrastructure, but also the sense of insecurity. I hope this won’t happen in Gujarat—all this comes to mind because of the unfortunate events last year.”

Bajaj turned once again to Modi: “We would like to know what you believe in, what you stand for, because leadership is important,” he said. “You are today the undisputed leader of your party and government in Gujarat and we want to know you better …We are prepared to work with governments of all hues, but we also have our own views on what is good for our society and what works for it.”

Modi listened patiently to the torrent of criticism, silent but furious.

“You and your pseudo-secular friends,” Modi roared at the leaders of Indian industry, “can come to Gujarat if you want an answer. Talk to my people. Gujarat is the most peaceful state in the country.” Tension filled the room. Modi continued, turning to Godrej and Bajaj: “Others have vested interest in maligning Gujarat. What is your interest?”

Modi carried his fury back to Gujarat, and quickly set about showing the CII who really had the upper hand. Within a few days, a group of Gujarati businessmen close to Modi—including Gautam Adani of Adani Group, Indravadan Modi of Cadila Pharmaceuticals, Karsan Patel of Nirma Group, and Anil Bakeri of Bakeri Engineers—had established a rival organisation, which they called the Resurgent Group of Gujarat (RGG), all of whose members threatened to withdraw from the CII on the grounds that it had humiliated and insulted Modi and all Gujaratis. The RGG issued a press statement swearing by the pride of Gujaratis, and demanded that the Gujarat chapter of the CII resign for “failing to protect the interests of the state”.

Faced with an open revolt from a crucial state and its powerful business community, Tarun Das had good reason to worry: more than 100 companies from Gujarat were threatening to leave the CII, which would cripple the organisation’s presence in Western India; back in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government began to limit the CII’s access to its ministers, jeopardising the group’s core mission as a lobbying organisation.

Das reached out to the BJP leader Arun Jaitley, then the Union law minister and a close friend of Modi, seeking to make amends. Over a two-hour conversation at his house, Jaitley quizzed Das on the CII and its intentions, and then told Das that he would raise the issue with Modi, who was expected to come home for dinner one day soon.

A few days later, Jaitley told Das that the issue could be resolved: Modi wanted a formal apology from the CII. Das was eager to oblige, though not without some hesitation, as he later recounted in a long post-retirement interview with Business Today:

“The evening I was leaving to meet Modi [to deliver the letter of apology], my wife accosted me, ‘You just can’t do this….’ Among our close friends are Anu Aga, Azim Premji, Jamshyd Godrej and several from the Parsi and Muslim communities. My answer was that I had two options: I could quit and say I will not do this. Else, I had to look after our members.”

* **His Days at the RSS**

The pracharak related an incident that took place during the Emergency: “We in the ABVP were told to organise agitations against the government, from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, and one day we were holding a meeting at the Bhullabhai Char Rasta in Ahmedabad,” he said. “We were supposed to speak against the government, but in a sober tone, because that was the Sangh style, and also the police and the intelligence agencies were watching over us. But while the meeting was on, Narendrabhai passed by on a cycle. He was furious at the composed serenity in our protest. He jumped onto the stage, grabbed the mike and began giving a rabble-rousing speech, spitting abusive words, and not hiding his anger against the government.”

“The audience loved it. But that night, at Hedgewar Bhavan, the senior Sangh leaders scolded Modi for his detrimental and unwarranted act—for a nearly-underground Sangh pracharak to come out in the open. ‘Forget about speaking,’ they lectured him, ‘you shouldn’t have even gone there. Even if the meeting failed, it would be okay, but discipline and obedience to one’s role is superior to all.’”

For all his allegiance to the Sangh and its ideology, the organisation’s structure and style—placing the group above the individual, restraining one’s anger, respecting the protocols established by the leadership—did not mesh with Modi’s personality.

Shankarsinh Vaghela, who was senior to Modi in the RSS and the BJP, and later became chief minister of Gujarat and one of Modi’s bitter rivals, recalled that even as a young man Narendra chafed at the strictures of the Sangh. “Modi used to miss the morning shakha quite often by sleeping late,” Vaghela said. “He always used to do things differently from others in the group—if all of us wore long-sleeved kurtas, he used to wear short sleeves, and when all of us wore khaki shorts, he wore white shorts. And I remember one day the visiting RSS leader Golwalkar questioning Modi in public for keeping a trimmed beard.”

* **How his economic record in Gujarat**

In the wake of the 2002 riots, Modi skillfully painted any criticism of his government’s misdeeds as an attack on Gujarat and Gujaratis. Over the past few years, and with considerably more subtlety, he has achieved the same thing with the story of the state’s development miracle. The government has relentlessly provided the media with positive stories of efficient administration, rapid construction and economic growth.

Modi likes to flaunt the fact that Gujarat is a power-excess state, and almost every big-picture story about the “Gujarat miracle”, from Business Today to The Sydney Morning Herald, highlights this fact. But farmers, led by the Sangh’s own farmers’ union, have been protesting for almost a decade that their electricity needs aren’t being met, and government statistics show that the share of power diverted to agriculture has fallen from 43 percent to 21 percent between 2000 and 2010. More than 375,000 farmers are still waiting for electricity connections for their irrigation pumps.

Even the headline figures for Gujarat’s economic expansion in the past decade diminish under closer examination. The state’s GDP growth has only slightly outpaced India as a whole over the past decade. But this is to be expected: Gujarat has long been an industrialised state—and in fact, growth rates under Modi are not significantly higher than they were in the prior two decades. Though Modi has presented Gujarat as the clear leader among Indian states in attracting foreign direct investment, it ranked fourth among states on this measure between 2000 and 2009, and in 2011 fell to sixth place, after Maharashtra, the National Capital Region, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh; Maharashtra has foreign direct investment inflows almost nine times greater than Gujarat.

Data from the Planning Commission, meanwhile, show that in spite of Gujarat’s economic growth, the state lags behind even Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in rates of poverty reduction. According to the 2011 India Human Development Report, Gujarat also scores poorly in several social indicators, with 44 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, worse than Uttar Pradesh.

By themselves, these statistics hardly constitute an indictment of Modi’s record. They merely suggest that his carefully constructed image as an economic miracle-worker has been the result of a well-managed public relations campaign whose false premise is that Gujarat stands head and shoulders above every other Indian state in growth and development—and that anyone who presents data to challenge this narrative is only twisting the truth in order to malign Modi and every Gujarati.

* **How he deals with opponents inside his party**

AT THE TIME OF THE 2002 RIOTS, Gordhan Zadaphia was Gujarat’s minister of state for home affairs—junior to Modi, who also held the home portfolio—and like Modi, he stands accused of complicity in the violence. A VHP leader in Gujarat for 15 years, Zadaphia joined the BJP in the early 1990s. “The RSS told me to work in the BJP, and I became a general secretary for the party in Gujarat,” Zadaphia explained.

He is also one of three prominent leaders in the Gujarat BJP—all of them with impeccable Sangh credentials—who spoke out against Modi’s autocratic style within the party. The first, Haren Pandya, who had served as Modi’s revenue minister, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in 2003. The second, Sanjay Joshi, who had become a general secretary in the national BJP, was forced to resign when a CD containing pictures of him with naked women—later determined to be fake—was anonymously circulated to top BJP leaders. And Zadaphia, the third, was pushed out of the cabinet by the end of 2002, and subsequently ejected from the party.

“Modi understands only one alphabet, and that is capital I,” Zadaphia told me. “I was threatened with death by Modi himself.”

“It was in February 2005,” Zadaphia continued. “I noticed an intelligence man from the state police following me, and when I confronted him, he told me he was instructed by the home minister’s office to shadow me.” A few days later, Zadaphia said, there was a meeting of BJP legislators with the chief minister. “I asked Modi in the meeting, ‘Narendrabhai, what kind of spy activities are you doing against your own party legislators?’ I asked, why is an intelligence man following me? Then Vajubhai Vala, a senior minister, took the microphone and said ‘Okay Gordhanbhai, cool down. We will look into it, but this is not a question to be asked now.’ Modi didn’t speak at all, but I got a note from his secretary that said ‘Please meet the CM.’”

“I met him at his chamber after the meeting. [Deputy home minister] Amit Shah was sitting there. Modi asked me, ‘Why are you asking these kinds of questions in public?’ I said, ‘What shall I do? It is not a private matter.’ Then he looked sternly into my eyes and said, ‘Khatam ho jaoge Govardhanbhai…’—You’re going to get finished.’”

“I asked him, what kind of finishing? Physically or politically?”

“He said, ‘You complained against me to LK Advani and Om Mathur in Delhi.’”

“I said, of course. There’s no option for me other than to complain to the people in Delhi. But if you’re saying you will finish me off, let me tell you, I’ll die when my time comes. Don’t try to threaten me again.”

Zadaphia moves around with a police escort and a dozen armed security men; as a former deputy home minister—and a controversial one at that—he was offered protection by the government after the riots. Pandya, however, did not have security guards. “Haren was bold,” Zadaphia said. “He thought nothing would happen to him. That was a mistake.”

A tall and handsome Brahmin with a fine RSS pedigree and excellent connections in the media, Pandya was a formidable political rival for Modi within the state BJP. The two clashed publicly for the first time in 2001, when Modi was in search of a safe assembly seat to contest after his appointment as CM. He wanted to run from Pandya’s constituency, Ellisbridge in Ahmedabad—a very safe seat for the BJP. But Pandya refused to yield to Modi’s wishes. As a state BJP functionary recalled, “Haren said, ‘Ask me to vacate my seat for a young man in the BJP—I’ll do it. But not for that fellow.’”

In May 2002, three months after the start of the riots, Pandya secretly gave a deposition to an independent fact-finding panel led by Justice VR Krishna Iyer. Modi could not have known what Pandya said, but written records show that Modi’s principal secretary, PK Mishra, instructed the director-general of state intelligence to track Pandya’s movements, and in particular those related to the fact-finding panel. The intelligence director took down the instructions in a register—the entry for 7 June 2002 reads as follows: “Dr PK Mishra added that Shri Harenbhai Pandya, minister for revenue is suspected to be the minister involved in the matter. Thereafter, he gave one mobile number 9824030629 and asked for getting call details.”

Five days later, on 12 June 2002, there is another entry in the register: “Informed Dr PK Mishra that the minister who is suspected to have met the private inquiry commission (Justice VR Krishna Iyer) is known to be Mr Haren Pandya. I also informed that the matter cannot be given in writing as this issue is quite sensitive and not connected with the charter of duties given to State intelligence Bureau vide Bombay Police Manual. It is learnt that the telephone number 9824030629 is the mobile phone of Shri Harenbhai Pandya.”

News reports soon revealed that an unnamed minister in Modi’s cabinet had deposed before the Iyer commission, and described for the first time the meeting at Modi’s residence on the night of the train burning, at which Modi allegedly told his top police and intelligence officers that there would be justice for Godhra the next day, and ordered the police not to stand in the way of the “Hindu backlash”.

The leak provided sufficient evidence for Modi to press a case of indiscipline against Pandya within the BJP, and two months later Pandya was forced to resign from the cabinet. But Modi was not finished. The state elections were due in December 2002, and Modi saw an opportunity to deny Pandya the Ellisbridge seat that he had refused to vacate a year earlier. “Modi never forgets, and never forgives,” the BJP insider close to the chief minister told me. “It doesn’t help a politician to have such longterm vengeance.”

And so Modi denied Pandya the constituency he had represented for 15 years. The leadership of both the RSS and the BJP objected and asked Modi to relent, but he refused. Near the end of November, RSS leader Madan Das Devi went to meet Modi at his residence, carrying a message from the RSS supremo KS Sudarshan, his deputy Mohan Bhagawat, LK Advani and AB Vajpayee: Stop arguing, don’t create division before the elections, and give Pandya his seat. Devi stayed late into the night, but Modi held his ground, the state party functionary said: “He knew he would start getting phone calls from [RSS headquarters] Nagpur and Delhi, since he did not listen to Devi. So that night, by 3 am, he got himself admitted into the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital for exhaustion and fatigue.”

Pandya, according to the party functionary, charged to the hospital to confront Modi. “Haren told him, ‘Don’t sleep like a coward. Have the guts to say no to me.’” Modi refused to budge, and the RSS and BJP leaders finally gave in. Modi left the hospital after two days, and handed Pandya’s seat to a newcomer. And in December, he came back to power riding the post-Godhra wave of communal polarisation.

Pandya, for his part, started to meet with every top leader in the BJP and RSS—in Delhi and in Nagpur—telling them that Modi would destroy the party and the Sangh for his own personal gain. Senior BJP figures, who still regarded Pandya as a valuable asset to the party, decided to transfer him to headquarters in Delhi as a member of the national executive or a party spokesman. “Modi even tried to scuttle that,” Zadaphia told me. “Pandya going to Delhi was going to be harmful for Modi in the long run.”

Three months later, in March 2003, on the day after Pandya received a fax from the party president ordering his shift to Delhi, he was murdered in Ahmedabad. The Gujarat police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced that Pandya had been assassinated in a joint operation between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Dubai-based underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Twelve men were arrested and charged with Pandya’s murder, but eight years later, in September 2011, the Gujarat High Court acquitted every single one and rubbished the entire case. “The investigation has all throughout been botched up and blinkered,” the judge said. “The investigating officers concerned ought to be held accountable for their ineptitude resulting into injustice, huge harassment of many persons concerned and enormous waste of public resources and public time of the courts.”

Pandya’s father, Vithalbhai, has publicly accused Modi of ordering his son’s killing, and moved a petition in the Supreme Court calling for the chief minister to be investigated, though the court dismissed it, citing a lack of evidence.

RB Sreekumar, who headed the state intelligence for a year soon after the riot, told me that he had been asked by the chief minister’s office to regularly give details about the movements and activities of Haren Pandya.

“I’m not saying Modi got Haren Pandya killed. I have no evidence. But the fact remains—anyone who speaks against Modi from inside the BJP gets finished either physically or politically,” Zadaphia told me.

I'm politically inclined towards the AAP party but that doesn't mean I'm a blind follower or a devotee. 

Now, BJP used its brain toward pro-Hindu policy by making its MLAs & MPs say that India will be a Hindu Rastra. But, their prime leaders like Modi, Shah, Rajnath, Sitaraman, Jaitly, etc never said that. 

They gained the Hindu votes in major states due to the pro-Hindu image & on the other hand, by removing triple talaq, they also gained the trust of Muslim household women. 

Now, the problem is that they've blindfolded their followers to the extent that they don't question even their wrongdoings. Whether, it was a pensioner scheme, TDS, GST, demonization, farmer bill, etc... BJPs followers just don't ask questions & that's the most powerful tool. We know that crime in the BJP-ruled states is almost the same, rapes, and kidnappings are common.  ED, CBI, ITD, and NCB have given clean cheat to BJP & they don't raid them.  There are more than  40% of criminal record MPs in parliament from the Bjp's side.   BJP came with the policy of MLAs buying scenario by which they destroyed the opposition. Current & former presidents too are puppets of the BJP. 

Business tycoon Loans were written of lakhs of crore. Privatization has more cons than pros. 

**Work done by bjp gov in power:** BJP gov. has done good work in the bringing of the internet & UPI. Its foreign policy is also fairly good. We've got many jets & upgraded weapons etc. THEREFORE, not everything is bad. 

**BJP has fooled Hindus by saying Hindu rastra etc but people need to understand that they're lying for votes & there will be no Hindu rastra. If that happens then there will be riots & we'll be back to -30 years.**  

**The opposition too is insignificant**. They don't have a face. Rahul Gandhi is a kid I pity. Mamta isn't worth it. Kejriwal is fairly good but he has no chance for 2024.

This can be the rise of INC if they take the steps rightly or it could be a fall also if they stay calm . Modi never ever speaks against Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge as he is a dalit and BJP is always afraid to lose their Dalit Vote share which is a huge majority. That's the reason BJP are taking advantage of RaGa to show that he's only the opposition and Kharge is not .

Modi never misses a chance to click pictures with Kharge to show how close he is with Dalits even if they are in my opposition .

Congress should take the right steps and let Kharge fight Modi and it will be an easy win for Congress in Karnataka which is extremely crucial for BJP for 2024 . Thats why Modi , Shah , Nadda are visiting Karnataka twice-thrice every week because it is a gateway to South India . People of Karnataka is clearly not happy with BJP and according to insider surveys , Congress is forming the government there

Around 14 Opposition parties have also appealed in Supreme Court against the Government misusing the Agencies like ED , CBI which will be heard by DY Chandrachud's Bench on 5th April .

Just like any other young chap these days, I started trolling other politicians to the extent that I was blocked by a few of them and their official handles.

In 2016, Demonetisation happened, I could sense the pain people were going through and I started asking a series of questions such as ""Why isn't he acknowledging the death of people?"", ""Did he make such stupid decisions in past which I'm not aware of because I'm blinded by blind faith in this guy?"" ""Why isn't he accepting his mistakes under his period as a PM? and asking to the extent ""Is he even a good guy?""

The year is 2019, I used to talk to this friend of mine a lot, we used to troll other politicians together because we were both blind supporters of Modiji (until I wasn't). I texted her a couple of weeks before the election, Here's how it went:

>Me: ""Sup? Who are you gonna vote?"".  
>  
>She: Of course, Modiji. How about you?  
>  
>Me: Maybe \_\_\_\_\_ this time.  
>  
>She: WTF? Are you stupid or what?  
>  
>Me: He's done good work, *yada yada yada* (some more logical points I thought were relevant in 2019)  
>  
>She: You're stupid, just dumbfuck. You should vote for Modi.

Her behaviour completely changed during that conversation after this point, we weren't friends anymore was the vibe I was getting from here so it's been 5 years since we last talked. At some point, this would have happened with a lot of you or will happen at once.

When I mentioned previously that they're better at this now, I can recall vividly people talking politics in my hometown or nearby in general, one would be supporting BJP, one would support Congress and someone would support others.

I never heard them yelling during discussions, I never saw any of them angry in a discussion, and I never saw any of them bailing a discussion because someone was asking stronger and valid questions. (Yeah, it all started with Modi's interview, when he bailed out of the discussion).

It's 2024 now, we are in the narrative of Modi vs Who? Either you're supporting BJP or you're a Congressi or some other party. This is the reason I stopped having discussions with any Tom, Narendra or Harry around me. What's the point of having a discussion when you can't even discuss it?

If I say Yes Rahul has no experience, and I'm a Modi supporter, if I say this action from Modi is wrong, I am leftist, if I abuse both of them I'm a liberal. When I disagree with something a liberal or a communist says, then I'm something else, a new category. If people can't think of a tag or category to label you, you're being abused. Now we've reached a stage where people have only 2 tags ""with BJP or AGAINST BJP""

As a wise man once said:**""Merciless criticism and independent thinking are two traits of revolutionary thinking. Lovers, lunatics and poets are made of the same stuff"" - BHAGAT SINGH**

So, I would say F\*CK BJP and F\*CK everyone else, you are entitled to have your own opinion. Let go of people rather than killing your thoughts.

Lucrative government advertisements couldn't be stopped because Modi still had to get his face out in the state media, but the tradition of a fairly independent and vicious news media coverage continued. Anytime the BJP makes a statement in line with their national strategies (Love Jihad, Beef, Sabrimala), the reporters simply do not report the news as-is, but actively question the BJP leadership in Kerala about their views. Visual media in the state also follows the tradition of newspapers, and pretty much every party owns a news channel and the only news channel that is favorable to the BJP is their own [Janam TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNVkxRPqsBNejO6B9thG9Xw).

2. The Hasdeo protest has received little to no action or media coverage.

1c8jmc6,1713596321.0,Ig1M,i think this is what happened in indian politics:,"(summary: quick view on politics, then my life experiences)

one government kept the freedom of criticism. so the films, activists, journalists, opposition, everyone openly spoke out whenever they had any concerns + putting down the government was/became ""cool"". emergency happened once, but it can't be used till the end of time, to justify every bad decision. plus whoever brought it, paid the price for it, in terms of the loss, plus in terms of life. 


then new government came in using the same freedom that previous government gave, they shut up everyone, and talkers were punished: fired/jailed/killed, plus everyone was self blamed: if you don't get a job, it's your fault. if you don't keep the job, it's your fault. if you do the job, it's your fault. you don't get quality, because it's your fault. you don't earn much, because it's economy/market fault. grocery-medicine-operations price doubling up? don't worry! risk your money in stocks! plus remember, we're not responsible for your loss! i can say with confidence that the youngsters are not jumping into gambling/betting/options trading for no reason. many of them are doing it out of desperation, hoping this is the last way. 


i have/had 1 friend, unable to see with eyes. not much job opportunities, plus whatever job is there, has to accept it, otherwise has to be jobless. another friend, has broken leg. no/not enough work from home opportunities. so basically, if someone gets handicapped, they might as well give up on their life. im asking this to any government. 


if you are poor & couldn't study, it's your, your parents fault. if you study & don't get job, your education is low quality. we always kept thinking we will find answers to the question, but when we did, they changed the questions.


figure of speech: if we bump the curd setting bowl once in a while, curd doesn't set correctly. if we open the freezer door once in a while, ice cream doesn't set up. we, the people will keep having bumps in our life, so our curd doesn't set up properly. 


my education once stopped because father's company was shut down, so the owner can sell land at high price and earn profits. i had to work, to save. after graduation, for 3 years nationalized banks didn't give me education loan. later i yelled/shouted at a private nbfc, then i got it at high interest. in form of amortised loan, so principal+interest repayment became due, even before college began. to pay it, i worked on low salary in desperation. 


during school days, i've acted in a kargil war related play. during college days i gave pulse polio vaccination to missed out kids, went to slums for ""sarva shiksha abhiyan"", where i gathered count of no schooling/drop out kids, and answered their questions about school/education. it wasn't for money +i didn't get any extra marks/help in any admission etc. towards end of HSC, i was a volunteer for HIV awareness, people's dignity. i actually listened to shaktiman शक्तिमान and told friends, colleagues to not eat tobacco/smoking & drinking.

during my customer care job, i took longer calls, while being punished for it, but i explained things properly to the people from village/low awareness. i spoke against incorrect conventions (untouchability/ colors being attached to religions), but also supported good deeds (giving back health insurance to employees, that are moved from permanent to contract, follow up with private insurance company, to give lakhs of rupees reimbursement to a security guards cancer facing wife). i pushed one employer to put dustbin, slippers in the women's washroom for their use. i helped office boys, housekeeping staff to check & withdraw/transfer their PF balance, handled people's accounts with OTPs, without fraud. in 2022, i got new job, when i got first salary of that company, i bought packs of crax and frooti, and gave 1 each to a building security man. i didn't give anyone alcohol party. 

studied for CAT finding books from all over the raddi sellers. didn't have money for classes, books & notebooks. i took notes over loose A4 papers in class, later made a notebook & acted to write, to save pages. while doing mba, i always remembered, there are hundreds of other students, who deserve this education, maybe more than i, so better make the best of it. took a female classmate to class teacher, to raise voice against sexual harassment by a male teacher. ran a youtube channel to explain my internship experience, tips for students, even stuff like how to tie a tie. it was taken down because of ""misleading content"". i was a class representative of the batch. while classmates were talking about ""enjoying college life"" i told them, ""remember there are hundreds of students, that are not studying MBA/ didn't get opportunities like you"". anyways they made fun of me. it's very much possible they went to movies with each other, plus ive seen 1 confirmed banging between my classmates, but i remained silent. they got small happiness in life, and i remained on my righteousness high horse. 

so far ive financially lent to 106 farmers (11-may-24 end of day), who need help for crop seeds/cutting/storage/ milk production/ fish farming/home business/shop/ tailoring/handmade goods, widows/rickshaw puller. i want to produce/give fever, cough cold, allergy medicines to poor people and i want to help kids with brain/cognitive/motor/mental limitations. but i know im not doing enough. one day, (now age 78) one business owner gave me a stern warning that im trying to do good things, that's okay, but i should look at my condition first. searched jobs for laid off employees. during virus, i explained science to neighbors, carried groceries & medicines during lockdown. ive taken time to find about lives of prostitutes, kinnars, emotions of LGBTQ+, war affected people-kids, criminals, serial killers (ted bundy, life sentenced criminals: men and women), addiction, drugs, suicide, self harm, abuse. dark side of humanity. plus good people. swami vivekanand. bhagat singh. 

after 19 years of formal education with 80%+ merit and 10+ years of work experience & achievements, i find myself without suitable opportunities, and parents couldn't afford own house, on my support we got a home on loan, but EMis are unpaid & we'll be out of the house soon. in FY23, if ~8cr people filed ITR and only ~2cr people earned enough to pay tax, so the 138cr people: the country, the happiness, this is/was never for us. im sorry. so far im not brave enough to sacrifice my life/put it in danger. because i don't think itll make any difference. plus why should i have to do it. my real awakening point was this: once my father was diagnosed by the doctor for running short of blood platelets. i rushed around, bought a bag of platelets. i didn't know who was the donor. i was aware enough to check the blood group match. donor could've been anyone: any gender, any religion, anyone. so if someone has helped me, i should be thankful. 

in 90's, we saw heroes in chitrahar चित्रहार , rangoli रंगोली, with bikes, car, jacket and posh houses. it was actually a cruel joke. mathematics is, just take 50 rupees film ticket from 50cr people. 2,500cr ready. then buy bungalow, flats in prime city, and wave at the fans. invest in business, and dump it on the investors, and secure next generation. this is the secret. this is the game. we/youth/kids think they'll imitate being a news anchor/analyst/ actor/model/ singer/dancer/filmmaker/ artist/analyst, what not, but we see these places are taken by/are being kept open for/being prepared for next generation of the current celebrities. talent is not the game, owning the distribution is the game. we're shown few examples of success here and there, but that's not the problem. the problem is, we're not 40cr population country. not 50, not 100. we have humongous size of population, and today we're in the expanding situation. we will be the highest number of humans in this age band forever, we all will grow and die close to each other.

1. Inaction on Anarchy: Internal security is a crucial factor to consider before voting. Modi has taken no action regarding Manipur, and there's no guarantee he will do anything if anarchy erupts in my state. He hasn't removed the state's Chief Minister, declared a state of emergency, or withdrawn the controversial proposed law. No measures have been taken against criminals like Brij Bhushan Singh.
2. Erosion of Democratic Institutions and Framework: The current government is not only undermining but also dismantling the democratic ecosystem of our country, employing the CBI and ED as political tools and eroding the powers of the democratically elected Delhi government. There are even plans to remove the Chief Justice of India from the Election Commission Committee. If they are given another 5 years, irreparable damage could be inflicted on our democracy. The Prime Minister isn't even attending parliamentary sessions these days.
3. Perpetual Silence: Modi rarely speaks about any issue, let alone taking responsibility for it and offering words of comfort. I don't want justifications from Shah or other Ministers, as I am not voting for my local leaders because of them.
4. Inclusion of Corrupt Leaders and Criminals in the Party: Although BJP claims to be an anti-corruption party, it doesn't hesitate to include corrupt leaders in its ranks. We've witnessed figures like Himanta Biswa Sarma, Suvendhu Adhikari, Ajit Pawar, etc., joining the BJP despite having been its targets in the past.

While BJP might continue to lose state elections to local bigwigs, they really have nothing to worry about (as it appears rn) in the Lok Sabha.

In effect, the state of Jammu and Kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. UTs have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a UT.** The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, like in Delhi and Puducherry. The UT of Ladakh will not, like Chandigarh.

So, not only has Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

It is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Non-Kashmiris might now get jobs in Kashmir. A process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

# Indian Opinion

Writing in the [Indian Express |  The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal  ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/), Pratap Bahnu Mehta says

>This is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. This is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. This is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. This is a state whose psychological principle is fear. This is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>India has betrayed its own constitutional promises. India has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of Kashmir. This act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. How can we justify offering Nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to Kashmir? Its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a Union Territory. This is a constitutional first. We are simply a union of Union Territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the Centre.

>What is playing out in Kashmir is the warped psyche of a great civilisation at its insecure worst. The BJP thinks it is going to Indianise Kashmir. **But, instead, what we will see is potentially the Kashmirisation of India: The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal.**

Writing in [The Wire | Constitution Torn to Shreds as RSS Indulges Article 370 Fantasy in Kashmir](https://thewire.in/politics/constitution-torn-to-shreds-as-rss-indulges-article-370-fantasy-in-kashmir) Siddharth Varadarajan says

>Not only has Union home minister Amit Shah stripped Article 370 of its essence, he has gone one step further and abolished the entire state as well, replacing it with two ‘Bantustans’ – grandly called ‘union territories’ – in which key decisions on a range of issues like law and order and land will be taken not by the people and their elected representatives, but by bureaucrats from New Delhi.

>Except, J&K has already enjoyed the rigours of Central rule for nearly 10 of the past 45 years, and has turned out none the better for it. The last 12 months have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the BJP helped run the state government along with the People’s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2018.

>Make no mistake about this – what Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have unveiled on Monday is not just an assault on the unique place that Jammu and Kashmir enjoys in India but on the very federal structure of the Indian constitution. If they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, Modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact – federalism.

Writing in the [Indian Express |  We are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) Imad Ul Riyaz says

>My appreciation for India, and that of many other Kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the Constitution. Today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. The issue is not just about the abrogation of Article 370 — it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. Most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were ignored.

Writing in the [Washington Post | Modi’s Kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) Barkha Dutt says

>Yet this serious gamble for the future of Kashmir — which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years — plays politically well for Modi and his home minister and second-in-command, Amit Shah. For one, it pleases Modi’s core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling BJP’s manifesto had always promised to implement this). Also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the “integration of Kashmir into the mainstream.“

>The Modi government has scored a political victory. But will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the Kashmir valley? One of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream Kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. Many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the Indian state. Weakening them further — one leader told me the latest move “reduces them to zero” — raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

He was suggesting good books to read for history he mentioned few amongst them was ‘Discovery of India’ by Jawaharlal Nehru (which is a really good book), what caught me off guard was the statement that followed - “reading this would prevent you from becoming Bhakt”, things went downhill from here according to me. He claimed BJP supporter as Bhakts and WhatsApp University scholar, which I was not expecting from someone of that scholarly prowess. I am nothing in front of him but I know for sure that not every congress supporter is ‘anti national’ similarly not every BJP supporter is a WhatsApp Graduate. Conversation moved and comparison of Modi with Hitler started, he had a view of Modi as a self-centred, egoistic man (which can be debated, but should not be claimed by a person working at an international platform in Public), he cited Nazi German philosophers to make his case of similarity b/w Hitler and Modi (which can be used against every populist leader in one or few aspects  - Trump, Indira Gandhi, Modi, Bolsonaro, Even Rahul Gandhi if he becomes PM with majority support). I on the other hand was responding in a way to hide my views on the subject, because I am practicing to restraint from showing my political biases in front of general public, which I think should be a necessity for someone working at influential positions.

It got me thinking that such eminent people can show political biases, how they would effect the minds of the people which gets to interact with them at such high offices like UN. Your thoughts?",5,57

[‘Everyone will regret it’, says PM Narendra Modi on scrapping of electoral bonds scheme](https://scroll.in/latest/1066682/everyone-will-regret-it-says-pm-narendra-modi-on-scrapping-of-electoral-bonds-scheme)

**The money trail has only been revealed after the Supreme Court scrapped the electoral bond scheme and forced the SBI to reveal the bond details. The Government tried its best to prevent that from happening. It also claimed that Citizens have no right to know the sources of political funding. Contrary to the claims made by Modi and Shah, BJP received 57% of the electoral bonds since its inception, not 37%.**

1. The stated purpose of electoral bond was to bring anonymity not transparency in the political funding.
2. Yet, the bonds were only anonymous to the public, while being traceable by the Government.
3. The Government deliberately misled the EC and overruled the RBI over electoral bonds.
4. The electoral bonds were introduced as a Finance Bill, bypassing the Rajya Sabha.
5. The Government lied about the bonds on the floor of the parliament.
6. With the electoral bond scheme, the Modi Government amended the Companies act to remove the limit on donations and allow shell companies and loss making companies to donate to political parties.
7. The Government also allowed foreign companies to donate to the political parties.

**The revelations of electoral bonds has brought to light the largest corruption, money laundering, and extortion racket in the nation's history.**

A gambling company accused of money laundering, a company which built the collapsed tunnel in Uttarkashi by flouting norms, a company that was accused of huge irregularities in the CAG report, a company for whose profit the Modi government weakened environmental laws, pharma comapnaies which failed drug tests, a telecom company for whose benefit the government changed auction rules, companies which were removed from the category of “high-risk” after donating funds, companies which made donations worth several times their profits, companies which made huge donations after being raided by the Income Tax Department, CBI, ED.

1) Parties get funded to run election campaigns and various political activities. These funds are not based on how many seats you win but rather how many seats you compete for. For example Congress would be competing with them for the same seats. Both would have to incur costs. So the number of seats they occupy isn't a fair measure but how many seats they run for would be the main criteria.
2) The funding received could be a little more or less based on the support they get from the general population, but these differences shouldn't be very significant because donations are from General Population. 
3) The fundings received here are from corporates and is much more than what is required for election campaigns. The corporates can't just donate money. Managers of Listed companies are agents of Shareholders (the general public). 
4) People who are insisting that corporates do this in other countries. First of all, lobbying is illegal in India. Why? Because a company may want to push agendas which might not be in line with the public's interest. The idea that just because you have more money, you have more influence would result in very significant income inequality resulting in rich people getting richer and poor people getting poorer. 
5) The countries where lobbying is legal, they'll have a lot of corruption going on. Having them as our gold standard is completely wrong. Secondly, even those countries have proper rules related to lobbying. This would still be illegal in those countries and termed as unethical lobbying.
6) A ruling party receiving funds is without any doubt can be deduced as quid pro quo. We might give certain companies projects not based on the quality/cost but how much money they are donating. This leads to tunnels collapsing, poor infrastructure and very less efficieny of taxpayer's money. 
7) A company doesn't give this amount of money if they're not getting more value from it. It's an investment for them and the returns are much more. It's not a ""donation"" at all.

http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/06/04/modis-full-court-press-in-india/

> The rule of law in India has been imperiled ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took power in 2014. **Some threats, such as vigilantism by Hindu extremists, have been largely ignored by the state. Others, like the intimidation of journalists, have often featured Internet trolls encouraged by BJP leaders. The most troubling instances have come directly from the government: when it has used investigative agencies to prosecute political opponents**—which, in the case of the Indian state of Bihar, enabled the BJP to join the ruling coalition—or when **it has elevated people accused of violent crimes to the top rungs of leadership, such as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath**. Yet recent events in the Supreme Court suggest something even graver is afoot—that **the basic structure of India’s democracy may be shakier than it had seemed**.

> **The crisis became impossible to ignore in January, when the second, third, fourth, and fifth most senior justices held an extraordinary press conference**. They told the media of their grave objections to the behavior of the chief justice, Dipak Misra, and they issued an ominous warning: “**unless this institution is preserved**,” they said, “**democracy will not survive in this country**.”

> ... The behavior of the current chief justice has called into question once again the independence and credibility of the Supreme Court. In April, when opposition parties sought to impeach Misra—**the first such attempt in Indian history**—they listed five allegations against him, including **involvement in a pay-to-play scheme, the falsification of official documents, and behind-the-scenes manipulation of sensitive cases. The outcomes of these cases have favored either Misra personally or the BJP**.

>... **At the time of his death, in 2014, Loya was a judge on a special court for India’s Central Bureau of Investigation. He was hearing a murder trial in which the principal accused was Amit Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trusted lieutenant and the current president of the BJP**. The alleged crime had occurred some years earlier, in the state of Gujarat, when the police had killed a man named Sohrabuddin Sheikh, and his wife, Kauser Bi, reportedly at the bidding of **Shah, who was then junior home minister in the state government, which was led at the time by Modi himself**.

> ... **The list of dubious circumstances goes on. The date on the electrocardiogram is incorrect; the occupancy register at the hotel appears to have been tampered with; and Loya’s phone was returned to his family with call records and messages erased**. The judge’s sister told Caravan that Loya had said that Mohit Shah, then the chief justice of the Bombay High Court, **the top court of Maharashtra, Loya’s home state, had offered Loya a bribe of approximately $15 million for a “positive judgment” in the Amit Shah case**. Loya’s father corroborated to Caravan the broad outlines of this story.

> ... The Loya affair is not the only Supreme Court case that has raised controversy. **The crisis began last fall, when Justice Jasti Chelameswar, the most vocally critical member of the court and its second most senior judge, agreed to hear a petition seeking a special investigation into allegations of bribery involving the chief justice. Misra responded by canceling Chelameswar’s order and directing the administration of the case himself, despite the obvious conflict of interest, along with handpicked junior judges. Predictably, a bench selected by Misra quashed the petition. The only people punished, in fact, were the petitioners, who were fined over $37,000 for making allegations that the Supreme Court described as “contemptuous, scurrilous, baseless, and reckless,” according to one newspaper**.

> ... Away from the spotlight on the Supreme Court, a lower court ruling in April also raised questions about judicial independence. **Swami Aseemanand, a Hindu extremist allegedly involved in five bombings in which 119 people were killed, was acquitted and allowed to walk free. Aseemanand has close ties to the BJP, including to Modi himself. He had confessed to his part in the bombings many times, including on one occasion to a Delhi magistrate**. Hours after Aseemanand’s acquittal, the judge presiding over the case resigned, citing “personal reasons.” According to the news and analysis website The Print, this judge faces an investigation for corruption in an unrelated matter—very like the predicament Bhushan suggests Chief Justice Misra finds himself in...

In the past, it was because BJP was pro-development, had a lot of money or because of their pro-Hindu ideology. 

What if the true reason is none of all that? What if the **root source** for their success is actually an organizational structure that functions much better than other parties? **Perhaps it is the organizational strength that brought them a lot of members, soon a lot of voters.** Watch this talk by Yogendra Yadav, a left-leaning activist himself, about BJP's election machine in the aftermath of 2019 elections from 8:15-10:15 ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQPgoW6sdHc)).

However, the recent elections even roped me in with all the drama, events and honestly excitement. 

I’ve been learning more and more about just the extent of lies and misinformation Urban Indians are being shown, the fake media, scams, and more. 

I’m relieved to say the least that atleast we have some semblance of an opposition now, and not a “400 par” center. God knows what they would do if they got that. 

But still, things like,
- The excessive focus on religion to win elections instead of real issues. 
- The brainwashing of people through Social Media and the News
- BJP “fans” hating on everyone and the level of irrational thinking that exists
- Modi having “fans” and “bhakts”, a person who is supposed to be a civil servant 

I’m not saying that only this Govt. is like this, I’m sure previous ones have not been any better, but did such brainwashing exist back then?

- Nowadays, even smart and educated people are not ready to even listen to an opposing view. 
- Everyone has been fed the belief that “If not Modi then who?”
- The level of scams and lies that have been done are not being conveyed to the general public
- Media, even during elections, was pro-BJP. I literally saw a Doordarshan Live Stream where they were roasting congress, and praising their Modi Ji, a channel supposed to be the national broadcast. 
- People have become haters, extremists and its not possible to even have a conversation anymore, people are not ready to change their opinions. 

My point is, it feels hopeless and I feel deeply concerned about the state of the nation. Makes it hard to even keep working on my business, and I keep getting distracted. Don’t even know what can I do. 

I have voted, but beyond this, do I just go back to staying away from news? My way to bring change is building my business, and create employment, and make impact like this. 

What do you people do when the hopelessness about the issues of the country strikes you? 

P.S. Please don’t troll or insult me, you can just tell me you disagree with me politely or ignore my post. ",8,17

Stuff that I heard :

* If it wasn't for Modi, more people would have died during the pandemic.
* I feel proud by looking at him.
* Yogi is a strong leader and he should be next PM
* Muslims are gaining power, they should be stopped.

These aren't just statements by a bunch of people but are strong beliefs held widely by a majority of the population. BJP has succesfully conducted a large scale social experiement that has fundamentally changed people's idea of what India is. It rode on people's faith to reach popularity and questioning the government directly hurts their faith. People are more polarized than ever and it is only growing. My father was a learned man who I respected because he saw things very clearly. Not anymore. He has been completely brainwashed and brings up unwanted political discussions every single day and has lost all objectivity.

118oqd8,1677039726.0,Ok_Business_266,How real is the Indian web-brigade?,"So I've been browsing some Indian-related subreddit lately, and I've noticed a lot of posts are quite outrightly spreading hate toward certain ethnical/religious/political groups, by posting a lot of contextless videos, photos, and word descriptions of the misdeeds done by the aforementioned groups.

Here are some examples:

1. a video showcasing a person of supposed Dravidian origin bullying a north-Indian fellow on a bus, the post titled as such: Dravidian goons bullying our boys.
2. a post titled as: Exactly what's wrong with north-eastern Indians? (forgot the content of the post but it wasn't very rational.)
3. Photos showing a Painting of a revered historical Hindu character (supposedly a great Raja?) being destroyed and scattered on the ground, the post titled as: Leftwing students destroy the Painting of great (XXX).
4. Muslim-scum post, do I need to find an example?

&#x200B;

So, as far as I can tell, these incidents all can possibly be true, no doubt about that, but they can also be individual incidents and not necessarily ethnical/religious/political related, nonetheless, the titles always suggest ethnical/religious/political struggle between these groups and the good old Hindu folks. The posts always seem to be spreading hate and invoking nationalistic sentiments intentionally.

So web brigades exists in many part of the world, that is a fact: 

In China there are the wumaos (50-cents being their reward per post/reply in pro-CCP fashion), in eastern europe there's the Kremlin-bots, in US there are the groups intentionally spreading news that were proven to be false and dumb, and of course in my country Taiwan there's the pro-Chinese web brigades everywhere. 

I'm just curious how real are such threats against democracy and peace happening in India?

Despite the cancellation,  many aspects were still overlooked, highlighting both direct and  indirect impacts on us. The introduction of Electoral Bonds by the BJP  was a direct assault on the very fabric of democracy and the welfare of  the average citizen. Here's how the seemingly distant concept of  electoral bonds represents not just a matter of elite corruption but a  direct threat to every Indian.

**1. Not Just Elite Corruption: It Affects You!**

Any Company, not making any profit even, was allowed to donate. Which means large sums of money, that could have been used to pay worker salaries, or create more jobs was diverted into the pockets of BJP. Your salaries are stagnant, but business revenue still goes up, so where is all that money going? One component of it is your corporate overlords willingly or unwillingly donated to Mogliji.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN NEXT FEW WEEKS: Look at the names of the companies who donated to Mogliji. If your company is listed and your salary has been stagnant for last few years, you know who profited over all of your hard work.

**2. A Free Pass for Loss-making Companies**

Imagine a company which is making loss. Gobi-ji's office reaches them and says, why don't you donate all of revenue to us. We will bail your loans out. Then BJP gets the corporate money, meanwhile later when the loans default, your tax money is used to bail out the corporate and the banks who were forced to give loans to such companies. Your tax money, which could have been used to fix roads, improve healthcare, reduce pollution, all of that was used to make Gobi-ji's retirement fund heavier.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN NEXT FEW WEEKS: After the donation list is made public, try to see the overlap with these companies that and the corporate loans that were waved off.

**3. The Invisible Hand: Unknown Donors Controlling the Government**

Perhaps most alarming is the absolute anonymity provided to donors of electoral bonds. This has opened the floodgates for unchecked, untraceable money to flow into the political system, allowing unknown entities to wield disproportionate influence over the government. Policies, decisions, and laws could be shaped by these invisible benefactors, with the common man left in the dark about who truly controls the levers of power. The democracy that is supposed to be of the people, for the people, and by the people is at risk of being hijacked by unseen forces.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN NEXT FEW WEEKS: Look for the names which look fake. Most certainly many fake companies were set up to divert black money into BJayPee's pockets.

**4. Policies were made keeping in mind the Corporate Benefits and not the People**

Tired of Low Quality Vehicle that you purchased for the exorbitant price tag? The Automotive company perhaps used Electoral bonds to pass the cheaper quality product through regulations. Got food poisoning due to a product you ate from a known brand? Probably corporate donation made FDA clear the product without checking it. These policies affect your day to day lives. 

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN NEXT FEW WEEKS:  Look for your day to day purchases and see how many of these companies were involved in putting money into Chaddi-ji's pockets.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Electoral Bonds and BJP have Screwed your livelihood. But you refuse to speak up.

&#x200B;

While you were trying to stay ""Apolitical"", all of the things that affect you were heavily politicized. Get involved, start speaking up. Otherwise nothing will change and things will only get worse. 

  
If you like this write-up, I will cover the names of the crooks who were involved in this scam.

bvhgmp,1559366664.0,ExMuslimHyderabad,An interesting take on Indian elections by Shekhar Gupta at Centre for Policy Research on 'How India Voted',"This is going to be a long read but one of the best post-election analysis that I've seen. I have transcribed, paraphrased, and highlighted what Gupta said [here](https://youtu.be/mL5quXQzLkY?t=4925).

Today Congress and the rest can complain about resources but in 2014 Congress was in power and Modi was an outsider and yet he won. To analyse this, we need to forget our voting preferences and admit that Modi’s rise is not a fraud on India. Modi’s is a phenomenon and has had a better story and a better product to sell for almost a decade. 

Since it suited everybody around Congress, they said BJP lost 2004 due to 'India Shining'. Cut down those number : **BJP just got 9 seats less than Congress. BJP lost due to Gujarat 2002 where BJP's previous allies (Mamata, CBN) were no longer willing to ally with them since BJP refused to fire Modi**

**Another myth was spread after 2009 when the incumbent came back with a larger majority than the previous one. Who do you then give credit to? If you credit it to MMS, it’s an outrage in the Congress party.** So you have to find an excuse and credit it to Mrs.Gandhi and whatever she had done. So you say loan waivers and MNREGA. 

In urban areas, where least poor 30% people live Congress party’s strike rate in 2009 was 68%. In the areas where 70% of Indias poorest live, Congress party’s strike rate was 30 something percent. This data was available, and the party was not willing to see the reasons that **India had seen 7 years of breathless growth and because the intellectual establishment and political darbaar of the Congress party was not willing to accept that, they undermined UPA2**,and pushed it back - people got so angry who got used to growth people brought in Modi from Gujarat because he’ll bring you something. 

**In this election campaign, the most striking thing was Modi getting away with saying that nothing happened in this country before 2014** - that history of this country begins in 2014. That is not true. **The previous 10 years had a lot of growth, built a lot of infrastructure - many things happened**. Look at the way global economic downturn was handled by India, it was a great economic success story. Look at how Satyam was handled. But the amazing thing was, in so many days of campaigning I never heard anyone from the Congress party say anything about what their govt did under UPA2. 

**This is the autoimmune disease of the Congress party. This Congress party wants to blame Modi, media - they’re watching the wrong channels. That fact is the only achievements the Congress party was willing to talk about was not even of Rajiv Gandhi but of Indira Gandhi when 80% of the voters are born after Indira Gandhi had passed away.** So don’t blame others. Look inside - the voter is transactional. The transaction for the voters is NREGA money, the gas cylinder, or it can also be the pride/security of the country and how good is the leader. 


**This idea of keeping India secular has been outsourced to it’s 15% muslims. The muslims are fed up because nobody does anything for them but you keep dragging them everywhere as if it’s their responsibility.** *You have to save secularism, I have the Yadavs with me, so and so will bring the Dalits.* Dalits are not with her anymore. She has has 10 seats, Akhilesh has 5 seats. That tells you that Mayawati is finished because Akhilesh has been able to transfer his Muslim votes to her, but she hasn’t been able to transfer her Dalit votes to him. The Dalit votes are now changing.

This time as I drove around the country I would just get ordinary people and ask who are you voting for and why and record it. I have 60 of these recordings. All 60 are voting for Modi. From north KA, south KA, Bengal, UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana. You can blame media, money, whatever but **if in Haryana if BJP can get 68% vote, and Haryana’s premier Jatt party INLD only gets 1.8% that tells you, that you are looking at something new.** Somebody just had a much better product. So respect the verdict, but for that first you have to first accept that there was a much better product on offer. 

People have been defeated despite money. Look at CBN, he wasn’t short of money in Andhra. **You can have a great organisation but you need to have workers who have the commitment.** Look at what YS Reddy has built in AP. It’s an organisation that can fight BJP anyway. Look at Mamata in WB - if it weren’t for BJP would have gotten 35 seats. 

**The voter in this country does not trust Congress schemes. Anything that happened in the past, very little got to the voter. This time LPG, the house, and toilets. I was looking for evidence to the contrary but we were not finding it. We were finding gas cylinders - we would even peek inside the houses and found gas cylinders. You build a house govt gave you 1.5 lac, you build a toilet and govt gave you 15k. The govt didn’t build anything for you - they used Direct Benefit Transfer. The used the JAM trinity. Jandhan - Aadhar - Mudra loans. Initially I thought Mudra loans were all rubbish and they were all fake. But I have videos of a Dalit saying that I got 50K mudra loans to build a chai shop and I pay 1300 per month back and if I don’t the branch manager comes. Check the data - 4.81 cr have gotten Mudra loans and 2.1 cr loans has been dispensed.**

**I have to say, we journalists and commentariat chose not to see it. Even when we see it, we compulsively tried to deny it. *“Oh they’ve got gas cylinders - but they cant afford the next one”.* But the fact is they got one. *“Oh the next one is full price”* - that is a lie - the next one is not full price. Next one you pay the full price and you get your subsidy back in the Jandhan bank account. But once you have the connection - you’re empowered. Once you have the toilet, *“Oh but water is not there”* - but the water will come. The fact is these people had never seen delivery of anything. And even if they got anything they did not see anything they could get without having to bribe including in most cases the NREGA wages.** So this is a big change. This is a big governance exercise - you may like it or not like it. But smart people will learn from it. KCR did, Babu did it and now Jagan will do it. Non-smart people will complain about. 

It’s wrong to say this is only Hindutva. Hindutva has helped Modi consolidate upper caste. I have never seen any caste vote bank so cohesive. Because they also see him as this guy having protected “merit” . Ensure that these other “faltus” don’t walk into this territory. He has taken away all the other OBC’s simply because caste based parties became family run parties. Because SP & RJD family run Yadav parties - Yadav stayed there, other OBC’s fled. Similarly for Dalits - jatavs became powerful, the rest have fled. 

In a lot of rallies, Rahul spoke out “Chowkidar char hai” - a lot of people spoke out went back saying “Ye angrez Aadmi hai, jo apna desi Aadmi hai aur khudse banke aaya hai use chor bol rahe hai” . There was this video going around where Priyanka was talking about Rahul being black belt, diving,pilot etc. This was being circulated by the other side! The ordinary people were saying they also wanted to dive, become a pilot. So they started asking what does Rahul do that he has so much money. This India hates elitism. Modi is now elite - he dresses well, he’s got style. People say he has earned it unlike you guys who came because your daddy gave it to you.",39,54
afrax5,1547434676.0,PlusCardiologist,BJP - Wall of shame. (Need suggestions),"Hi,
I'm trying to make a list of all the shameful things that BJP did in the last 4 years. Is there anything I might have missed? My plan is to objectively look at BJP's wrongdoings in the last few years. 

Please comment with all the mistakes you think BJP made in the last few years.

* **Demonetisation**: I think this was very stupid. No one really got any benefit of this decision. Many people died. We don't see any significant change in digitization. All money seems to have come back to the RBI. No black money unearthed. Even BJP supporters didn't support this move.
* **CBI controversy**: CBI director was removed without giving him a chance to speak. He was transferred at 2am in the night very hastily. To add to this, all CBI officers who were investigating Asthana were also transferred.
* **Statue of Unity:** While I agree that national symbols are important, I think it was a bit excessive. Not to mention it was constructed during the same time farmers were agitating against the Govt. Now different BJP govts are making other statues too.
* **Farmer agitation:** Farmers agitated against the Govt. because farmers were barely making a living by growing crops and most of the money went to rich middlemen.
* **Yogi comments:** Yogi Adityanath made some very anti-muslim comments and nothing happened to him. Instead he was made CM.
* **No Modi (unscripted) interviews:** Modi didn't give any TV interviews in the past few years. The few interviews he did were obviously scripted.
* **No Modi Press Conference:** Modi didn't hold any PC in his term as PM.
* **Upper-caste quota**: Most learned people have said that this Upper caste quota is a terrible idea. Not to mention it was arbitrary and no siginificant public research was done before this decision.
* **Rafale Deal:** A lot of details of this deal weren't made public quoting ""Defence secrets"".
* **Increased intolerance:** I feel like general intolerance has increased. People making fun of Modi get arrested etc. At least during MMS, we could make jokes of MMS and RaGa.
* **Stupid spokespersons:** The current BJP spokespersons: Sambit Patra, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Shubhrastha Shikha I think are terrible and make no attempt to make any sensible comebacks to arguments. They just keep talking about how Nehru ruined India in the past 60 years. They have to realize that the people of India want answers and are tired of listening to Nehru as the reason for every bad thing happening in India right now.
* **Yogi:** He in general keeps making these stupid statements: [like this](https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-mocks-rahul-gandhi-says-poor-fellow-sat-in-kashi-vishwanath-temple-in-namaz-posture/942955/). There are more examples, will update later. Plus he also renamed a bunch of villages and equated their original names to naming your kids ""Ravan"".
* **Jobs:** I don't have any statistics but I read a ton of news reports that there is a dearth of jobs in India.
* **Ganga:** BJP promised to clean Ganga but nothing substantial has happened yet.
* **Farmer suicide data hidden:** BJP Govt. has hidden farmer suicide data from the people. [1](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/centre-has-no-farmer-suicide-data-since-2016-minister-told-parliament-1965532)
* **New GDP:** BJP brought a new GDP calculation system that shows them in good light.


It would be great if someone could talk about specific bills/laws passed in the parliament that were bad. I know they passed a bill that made Political donations anonymous and prone to illegal donations.

Modi, who was born in 1950, sold tea at the age of 6 years in Vadnagar railway station, But Vadnagar only had tracks passing through it. The actual railway station was built in 1973, when Modi was 23 years old.

Modi was underground during emergency but did his graduation from Delhi University in 1978.

Modi did Masters of Entire Political Science from Gujarat University in 1983 without the graduation certificate from Delhi University.

Modi is the only person in the world who has Masters’ Degree in the Entire Political Science. Even Professors of Gujarat University came to know of this course after 2014.

Modi took admission in the Masters’ of Entire Political Science degree alone, gave the exam alone, and took the degree alone. So far, no student or professor has claimed to have studied with Modi.

Even before the introduction of computers in India,Modi’s degree was printed by a computer.

Before Modi’s degree in 1978 and even 10 years thereafter, degrees were hand written by the University staff.

The font that was patented by Microsoft in 1992,was used to print Modi’s degree in 1978.

Modi’ degree was printed on a Sunday, when offices were closed.

Modi used digital camera in 1987 or 1988, taking a photo of advani's rally, even though the first digital camera was available in the US in 1990 and probably 5-10 years later in india.

1988 was a great year for Modi as he also sent an email to Advani, even though mass usage of email around the world hadn't started yet

ed88xg,1576836362.0,Nairato,"There is a ""hopelessness"" situation here where everyone think you can't win against BJP in 2024. This is not true. We can win and all it takes is to win in 40 more seats than what we got right now.","BJP may look like undefetable right now, some are so devasted by last election results that they think there wont be any elections now. Don't lose hope like that.  We can easily pull them down in next election. 

Infact even in the current election, if they had got less than 272 instead of current 303, we could have had our own government. Just look at how we were able to wrestle power in Maharashtra even though we got so low number of seats and BJP had so many seats. But now, we have got control of a hyper-hindutva party - Shiv Sena and got their Udhav thackeray to say  [Mixing religion with politics was our mistake: Uddhav Thackeray](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mixing-religion-with-politics-is-our-mistake-uddhav-thackeray/articleshow/72887017.cms)

The truth is that most parties within NDA hate Modi government because due to their sheer majority, BJP alone is eating the biggest share of the corruption loot. These parties will jump towards any direction which will offer them something more. Just like Maharashtra or Karnataka has shown.

If we had worked a bit harder and got just 40 seats more, we wouldn't have Article 370 removal, CAA, NRC and other disastrous situations. Right Now BJP is at its peak with ultra high majority but this also means now there is only one direction for BJP to move, which is downwards. If they lose just 40 vulnerable seats, they are finished. Look how vajpayee govt fell on its nose in 2004 even though they themselves had predicted that they would win majority and pre-poned the elections!

**Come on guys, we can bring Indian govt to the knees. Don't loose hope!**",314,56

gwn0k5,1591294998.0,guruaadmi,"As Covid goes out of hand, Modi goes back to yoga, acronyms and nationalism In the beginning, Narendra Modi took complete ownership of the Covid issue. With the migrant labour crisis and the growing spread of Covid, Modi is moving on to other things to protect his image.","On the issue of Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has delivered a televised ‘address to the nation’ on five occasions.

On 19 March, he ‘addressed the nation’ to announce a day-long ‘Janta Curfew’ as a drill for the upcoming lockdown.

On 24 March, he appeared again on TV to announce Lockdown 1 with four hours’ notice.

On 3 April, he re-appeared to ask people to light lamps and candles for nine minutes.

On 14 April, on the day Lockdown 1 was supposed to end, Modi did another TV address to announce its extension by 19 days in what would be Lockdown 


However, Lockdowns 3 and 4, as well as ‘Unlock 1’, did not see a televised address by Modi. Between Lockdowns 3 and 4, Modi appeared on TV to announce an economic package that he claimed was worth Rs 20 lakh crore.

This timeline tells you how the prime minister began dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic like a general leading a war, but who has since moved on. As Covid cases and death figures rose, as the economic pain of the lockdown became unbearable and the government’s handling of the migrant labour crisis more and more indefensible, the Modi government has sought to shift the narrative away from Covid.

At some point, the headlines changed from ‘Modi extends lockdown’ to ‘NDMA extends lockdown’. As the situation worsened, states were given a great deal of freedom in deciding their own lockdown policies. So now we can discuss which states are doing well and which ones are doing badly. The judgement is no longer on Modi.

In other words, PM Modi shifted to carefully protecting his image from the Covid lockdown just as the national consensus on the lockdown began to turn negative. Surveys and experts may not agree, but the government’s own response tells you it anticipates a political cost in being seen as steering the Covid and lockdown policies and is clearly spooked by the labour crisis.

Covid-19 in India is clearly out of hand, with deliberate under-testing and data fudging making the numbers look manageable. What the ‘official data’ can’t hide is that Mumbai has been running out of hospital beds and Delhi of cremation facilities and burial grounds. And we ain’t seen nothing yet.



The return of Shah

The prime minister has even stopped his video consultations with chief ministers. Instead, Home Minister Amit Shah uneventfully discussed the situation with chief ministers on phone.

Speaking of the Home Minister, his long silence before cameras and the eventual breaking of the silence is a mystery wrapped in enigma.

He spoke before Parliament on the issue of Delhi riots in March, and then Covid-induced lockdown took over. That’s when Amit Shah went so silent that rumours took root of serious health issues. These rumours became so strong that he was forced to deny them — only in writing, on Twitter.

After two months of the public not getting to hear the Home Minister’s voice, he is back with a bang, giving long interviews to news channels on the Modi government’s completion of one year in power in the second term.

If it wasn’t health issues, what accounts for the long silence of over two months? Perhaps the answer again was in image management. The division of labour between Modi and Shah seems to be such that Modi speaks mainly on matters of governance, positioning himself as global statesman and the nation’s patriarch. Amit Shah is the face of Hindutva and party politics.

If this assessment is correct, then Shah’s return to TV screens signals a return to business as usual, the pandemic becoming a side story. His apparent good health should confirm that his long silence was political. Now, Amit Shah answers the uncomfortable questions such as those on jobless workers, and Modi goes back to the never-ending promises of high economic growth and ‘Achhe Din’ (the good days).

Stretching public memory

It is for this reason — distracting public attention away from Covid and lockdown — that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has gone big on celebrating the sixth anniversary in power despite the public facing a pandemic and millions of labourers suffering crushing unemployment, poverty and the hardship of returning home.

Even the smallest of the Modi government’s achievements over the last six years, such as an amendment to a chit fund law, are being recounted. A BJP promotional video even counts not joining the ASEAN-led trade body Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as an achievement. This must be the first time that not doing something is counted as an achievement.

This suggests a desperation on the BJP’s part to make its voters remember all the high points of the Modi government over the last year, so that they don’t judge it by its poor handling of the labour crisis alone.

There’s an unmistakable defensiveness, which was also palpable in Prime Minister Modi’s latest Mann ki Baat, his monthly radio show in which he positions himself as the patriarch of the nation. In the latest episode, he spoke very little of Covid and lockdown, expressing empathy with the plight of labourers but pretending it wasn’t a poorly planned lockdown and that Covid alone was responsible for their suffering.

Instead, Modi spoke at length about his government’s health insurance scheme, claiming its beneficiaries had crossed the one-crore mark. As rising Covid numbers will put a spotlight on the poor public health infrastructure, Modi’s supporters will be able to talk about Ayushman Bharat Yojana to put the blame on state governments and 60 years of non-BJP governments.

The Modi government finds it much easier to play on a turf it has already excelled in: politics, elections, nationalism, and showing economic dreams that keep becoming ever so distant. That is why we don’t hear Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan speak much and the health ministry went without a briefing for eight days. The message from the government is that Covid and lockdown are not on top of its agenda anymore.

As Modi stopped addressing the nation over every lockdown, the ministers started speaking and giving interviews. This helped ministers take flak and protect Modi’s image.

Repeat after me

The health ministry switched off its briefings at the same time as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of a second economic package over five long press conferences.

The greatest trick in the Modi government’s publicity playbook is repetition. Just like a product ad plays again and again on TV until you have memorised it, the Modi government repeats its slogans and talking points until they have been drilled into your head. It does this not only with campaigns (such as anniversary celebrations) but also with its policies and decisions it makes.

Any policy decision by the government goes through a one-month publicity plan. First, the big announcement. Then, detailed press conferences and interviews by ministers. Third, the cabinet approval. And lastly, notification. These steps are comfortably spread out to allow each step to have its own publicity plan, each step presented as a ‘bold’, ‘historic’, ‘game-changing’ ‘masterstroke’.

We saw this with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ package too, allegedly worth Rs 20 lakh crore. Like a campaign, it has a name, and its rollout will repeat its content every week, presenting them as a new initiative every time. The actual economic stimulus or new spend by the government may only be a small fraction of Rs 20 lakh core, but the publicity is more than worth Rs 20 lakh crore.

It is therefore not surprising that the Modi government seems to have made up its mind to hold the upcoming assembly elections on time despite the pandemic. Elections is when the Modi government’s propaganda machinery is at its best, why would it want them postponed? But before that, there’s the International Yoga Day that must ensure we do not talk about labourers for much of June. To begin with, Modi wants you to participate in a video blogging contest showing your yoga poses.

When javed akhtar made fun of pakistani people at an event in pakistan, they didn't hesistate to take it in stride. You try even fact checking people here and everyone frim mainstream journalists to right wing influenzas discuss the cruelest and best way to eliminate you.

Just now I saw a video of a Muslim wedding where the father of the bride is blessing her and kisses her on the cheek and it is being shared with a vulgar caption. This is one of many such videos. These saffron degenerates can't even take a shit without cursing a Muslim. How unhinged are these people with hatred?

I am a hindu and sorry to say but I feel ashamed of these people propagating so much filth, hatred and disgusting narratives. The BJP got such a huge mandate and is the richest political party. And one thing is clear, they are very effective at spreading hatred by pouring money via an organized campaign online. They could have done so much more in the last 10 years but instead chose to imbibe the caveman mentality on us while doing mediocre work and tutting their own horn. 

This hatred is not limited to social media but you can hear it in opinions of the people around you. I feel extremely hopeless seeing the situation today and I'm actively going to try to immigrate literally anywhere else. The country has gone to the dogs.

1cvnucz,1716123907.0,ThePolyamCommie,The frenzy around the general elections makes no sense to me. ,"Every five years, we witness people get into a frenzy before and during any elections, especially if the election in question is a general election. For me personally, all of this frenzy makes no sense to me, whether it be the antics of BJP supporters or the antics of Congress supporters. To me, both the BJP and the Congress are merely the two sides of the same coin, if one understands that the interests of both parties are aligned with the interests of the oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes. 

I'd first like to address those who're supporting the BJP:

Under the garb of ""development"" and ""investment"", what y'all are really doing is nothing more than facilitating the loot and plunder of our country by the various imperialist powers of the world, specifically selling off our country and its rich resources to the tender mercies of US imperialism. And to prevent anyone from protesting against this loot and plunder, y'all aren't just happy with destroying the communal harmony of this country, you're also taking away the bare minimum of features that allows the Indian State to at least pretend that it's ""democratic"". I'm not saying and I'm never gonna say that the Congress or its supporters are better than you, because they are mere mirror reflections of you, but that the only difference between you two is that you guys managed to destroy our country in ten years that the Congress took sixty years to do - which perhaps reflects an increase in the efficiency of screwing over this country and its people. The material conditions of our country has been bad, and y'all are more than happy to make it even worse, just so that the oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes that you guys are unwittingly serving get a higher profit margin. 

To those who're supporting the Congress:

All of the talk about the ""death of democracy"" that you guys engage in makes me laugh in both annoyance and incredulity. ""Death of democracy""? This country has never been democratic in its ""independent"" history, and the Congress has been the first party to destroy that façade of ""democracy"" that you and BJP supporters tuggle over in your rhetoric. In many cases, the Congress themselves have been responsible for setting the stage for the BJP to come into power, where the socio-economic policies of the Congress has not been any different from that of the BJP. All of the posturing that the Congress has been doing are policies that the Congress didn't even consider to carry out while they were in power, but now, they're talking about it solely because they wanna win a Parliamentary majority against the BJP. Such political opportunism sickens me, as much as the fascism of the BJP does. 

TLDR: Neither the Congress nor the BJP is the answer. The only way to make to truly make our country into an actual sovereign, socialist and democratic republic is through a revolutionary movement aimed against feudalism and imperialism. Otherwise, no amount of voting can change this situation. ",0,23

yfqg8g,1666969163.0,rishianand,Is it a victory of Arvind Kejriwal or Narendra Modi?,"Two days ago, Arvind Kejriwal held a press conference to demand the pictures of Laxmi and Ganesh on Indian currency note. Sitting in front of portraits of Babasaheb Ambedkar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh, he claimed that doing this will revive the economy. Soon after, several leaders of AAP, including Atishi and Saurabh Bhardwaj also reiterated this demand. Today, Kejriwal has written to Modi to demand the same.

How this move will fix the economy, is anyone’s guess. Aam Aadmi Party claims that this tactic has put the BJP on defensive, and thus is their victory. On the contrary, it is the victory of Narendra Modi. A senior political leader once said to me, the greatest victory of an ideology is not electoral victory or forming governments; it is when they change the entire politics, that even the opposition adopts the same ideology.

Only a few days ago, AAP leader Manish Sisodia claimed that they will not speak on the issue of Bilkis Bano, because they want to stay on the issues of education, schools, healthcare, and employment. Yet, today, the entire party is focused on the issue of putting the picture of Laxmi-Ganesh on currency notes.

AAP has a history of not taking a stand on important issues of communalism. They refused to take a stand during the Delhi riots, the CAA-NRC movement, and the violence at JNU and Jamia. They supported the abrogation of Article 370, and the oppression of people in J&K. In recent years, they have been openly supporting Hindutva causes and narratives. During the demolition of Muslim homes in Jahangirpuri, AAP leaders including Atishi claimed, without any proof, that all those Muslims are Bangladeshi, and have been settled by the Modi Government.

No sane person can believe that the currency issue will hurt BJP. What if, tomorrow, BJP agrees to put the pictures of Laxmi-Ganesh on pictures. Is it unimaginable for the party based on Hindutva and communalism? Journalist Meghnad rightly observed,

> It's like saying, “Oh BJP wants to take away voting rights of minorities? Wait… we can suggest worse ideas so that BJP is forced to say they respect minorities & would not actively harm them.”

If from not speaking against communalism to openly advocating Hindutva, is supposed to be the victory for AAP, where does the party draw the line? Will it also start giving hate speeches to outsmart BJP and win votes? If then, what is the difference between AAP and BJP, and is it not the victory of Modi?",38,27

120n2ro,1679670318.0,Time-Profession6258,Why I will be voting for UPA in the upcoming 2024 elections and why you should do the same,"I intend to cast my vote in favour of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in the upcoming elections for a myriad of reasons. 

1) As the largest opposition bloc, UPA holds the most promising potential to emerge victorious against the incumbent ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Casting my vote for a smaller party or independent candidate would be futile, as they are likely to be easily bought by the BJP.

2) Congress, has governed the country for over six decades, yet has never caused as much destruction to the nation's social fabric as the BJP has in the past nine years. This contrast reinforces my belief that a UPA-led government would undoubtedly be better at ruling our country than BJP.

3) Casting a vote for None of the Above (NOTA) would be an imprudent waste of our democratic right. Opting for such a choice would indirectly assist the BJP's triumph, which is antithetical to our aim of unseating them from power. Instead, in constituencies where deciding between candidates is challenging, voting for the one with the best chances of defeating BJP is a pragmatic strategy. At this juncture, expunging BJP from the Centre is paramount.

4) Every political party has its shortcomings, and it is our responsibility to elect the lesser of two evils. By adopting a rotation of power every term, we can ensure that no party gets overly comfortable or audacious enough to undermine our democracy. Currently, BJP's prolonged stint in power has made them brazen, and it is imperative to curtail their complacency by bringing in fresh leadership.",467,246

My friends have told me DMK has earned 1.6L crores through 2G scam. But in reality, 1.6L crores is the amount the government could have profited if the 2G spectrum were given via auctions. And yet 1.6L crore is an highly exaggerated number provided by CAG. And the CBI and ED were not able to find the money trail.

1czsjm8,1716577521.0,karatuno,Why I'll press NOTA tomorrow,"Here are my arguments:

* **BJP**:
   * **No Accountability / Corruption / Spineless Media**: No one can question the supreme people, they have a god complex, and people protesting and questioning are labeled and threatened, courtesy of the RSS. The Finance Minister is always angry and never answers questions directly. The Prime Minister has never dared to give an unscripted interview. Local party people think they are above the law and live under the impression that they will be saved anyway and can do anything. As you see, the topic of corruption is swept under the table. You hear about so many issues, but everything just vanishes. Corrupt politicians change their party to BJP, and every paisa of theirs is turned white.
   * **Fans/Bhakts**: Modi and Shah should give lectures at MIT/IIM on how they made crores of people their best salespersons and, in return, how they took their spine and made them impotent.
   * **Hate-Mongering**: I ask the people voting how one can turn a blind eye to this, or you also have the same hate, so yeah, I understand why you vote for them. There's no in-between.
* **Congress**:
   * **Worst Opposition**: You are given topics served on your plate, and you still can't hold the government accountable. How can you even allow the government to do whatever it wants? You can't even select the issue properly because it may hurt your party people. If you fail to play the opposition correctly, how can one expect you to do well when you are in power?
   * **Rahul Gandhi**: Congress was given 10 years to fix and contemplate their mistakes. The biggest of them all, Mr. Gandhi, who I don't understand where he has studied to get his sense of social justice. His views on reservation were very scary, showing how ill-taught he is. Congress needs a better leader, and this country needs a better opposition.
* **AAP**:
   * **India Alliance**: When your whole party was made with a promise to remove corruption, then why shake hands with the corrupt? You cannot even learn from your mistake of allying with Congress in your first election. How can you even shake hands with Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Yadav? This kind of decision is beyond me. Someone asked Atishi that their local candidate, who is standing against the BJP candidate, is a gangster; she suggested the person vote for the gangster because eradicating BJP is more important. These kinds of things are deal breakers for me.
   * **Liquor Policy Scam**: As much as it is understandable that BJP is trying to get their hands on him somehow, that does not make him innocent. The judgment is still yet to be made, and people should not give him a direct clean chit based on that.
   * **Corruption**: This is my biggest pain point. If you live in Delhi, you know how corrupt Delhi government departments are, from DSSB to Delhi Jal Board. This was not the case in the first 5 years of AAP government, but things have changed again for the worse. They asked to vote them into the MCD, and we, the people of Delhi, hoped for better MCD work, but the corruption and cleanliness are still the very same today too. Corruption in MCD is world-famous, and they have not been able to clean it up.
   * **Just like BJP**: They feel some set of people will vote for them in any case because they feel they are the better option for the people in Delhi compared to BJP. But I say no free vote for you this time.

You might say you are just wasting your vote by pressing NOTA, but I just feel we need better politics in this country.

Edit: Did not press NOTA. Instead voted for BJP (jk). But yeah changed my vote. I used to think if NOTA gets more than 50 percent of votes, voting is reheld in that consitituency, but I was wrong. If something similar comes up only then, it can turn into some powerful signal else not. ",0,37

7tv1w0,1517255926.0,uncledoobie,What is your honest opinion of PM Modi and the BJP?,"I'm an NRI that grew up in Chicago (was born in Mumbai, but then brought back to the US when I was about a year and a half), and try to keep up on Indian politics and the country as a whole.  I should preface this by saying my extended family in India is in definitely in the upper echelon of society from older family-run businesses, so their opinions of politics and the economy and Modi by extension are that of conservatism and praise, respectively.  

Growing up, my view of Indian politics was that everyone was essentially always corrupt, from the top to the bottom, but the BJP was marginally better and when Modi came along it was going to push India forward from stagnating under Congress.  This was influenced a lot by the more borderline Hindu-nationalist / anti-Pakistani trains of thought from my parents and their generation.  So I'm genuinely curious to hear from you all who live in India and work there every single day, how much change has actually been brought on by Modi to make the country better.  I just recently visited Mumbai and then went to Nagpur/Tadoba, and having visited the country with gaps of a few years between, I personally have noticed a lot of improvement.  There seems to be a growing sense of national pride, from keeping the streets clean (more or less), massive development and construction projects (Mumbai metro, towers / cranes everywhere) to people believing there is some small chance of corruption at the very least being toned down.  Again, this is a very, very narrow view.  I'm troubled by the lack of action on the front of LGBTQ rights and Modi's opinion on environment change.  I was actually in Kamala Mills the day before the fire broke out, and see that in fact the local corruption I'd seen growing up and hearing about simply hasn't gone away.  

I'd love to hear all of your opinions on this to really get a sense of what's happening in the day to day lives of everyone.

I personally voted NOTA in 2014 because I thought AAP had no chance. Then AAP IN 2015 because Kiran Bedi was horrible. I will be happily voting for them again and this is the first time this has happened in my life. Instead of lesser evil, I am voting for someone good.

Kejriwal has many shortcomings, but he has shown time and again he is willing to change and focus on serving the people instead of pulling cheap tricks. That's all we can ask for in a CM really.",765,100

tehtzb,1647322677.0,account_for_norm,Indian people dont have any recreational hobbies,"I visited a lot of indians after covid, and this has been my observation growing up as well. Most Indians dont have recreation activities at all. I live in US now, and many people have regular outdoor recreational hobbies and the ones who dont will at least go for a hike, swimming, tennis, golf sometimes.

A lot of indians work 6 days a week, with minimal vacation days, and are simply exhausted. Most in their 30s have kids, family, in-laws drama etc taking away their time. Also, there are not too many avenues for such activities, because everything is so crowded. You cant go for a quick hike, you have to plan a whole thing with your family, who comes back home when, who has class etc etc. Even when there was a park right next to my house, we didnt go there that often. People in my society were just so beaten down by life i guess. 

So what i observed is, indians spend their time, if at all available, sitting and talking with their friends, alcohol, prime time tv etc.

I want to say that this has effect on our politics. They dont grow as people, they dont read books, they dont expand their circles, dont get to see new perspectives. Plus, having such small worldview makes you hateful of things, people you dont know. With no recreation, the work, family stress just festers in your mind, which manifests as hate. 

Maybe thats why people get so attached to stories like Rhea Chakraborty for months, which should have no impact really. But you tell me if i m wrong in this train of thought.",3880,685

In the press conference, Atishi claims that BJP was peeved after Kejriwal's release and they hatched a plan with Maliwal at the centre to malign Kejriwal. Atishi claims that Maliwal came at the CM's residence in the morning and demanded to meet the CM. When her request was denied, she created a scene and threatened the CM's staff. 

This is the video that Atishi is basing her claims on: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/exclusive-video-shows-swati-maliwal-at-arvind-kejriwals-home-after-alleged-assault-2540310-2024-05-17

>Ever since @ArvindKejriwal ji has come out of jail, BJP has been furious. In this sequence, BJP hatched a conspiracy and Swati Maliwal ji was made the face of it.

>Swati Maliwal ji reached CM residence without any appointment and she wanted to accuse the Chief Minister, but the CM was not there at that time and he was saved. After this, allegations were made against Vibhav Kumar ji.

>A video that surfaced today has exposed the truth of Swati Maliwal's allegations.

https://x.com/AamAadmiParty/status/1791456934039560252

>In the FIR to Delhi Police, Swati ji has claimed that she was brutally beaten up. Her head was injured and her clothes were torn. She has said all these things in her complaint.

>But in the video that has come today, nothing like this is visible. The video is showing the truth to the contrary. She is sitting comfortably on the sofa. She is threatening the policemen and Vibhav Kumar ji in a loud voice. She is using abusive language.

>The video today has made it clear that all the allegations made by Swati Maliwal ji are false and baseless.

>Vibhav Kumar Ji has filed a complaint against Swati Maliwal Ji with Delhi Police and he has narrated the entire incident that happened on 13th May.

>On May 13, Swati ji reached the CM residence without any appointment. When she was stopped at the gate, she threatened the security personnel and went inside.

>After this, she forcefully went and sat in CM's residence and started insisting on meeting the CM there.

>After this, Vibhav Kumar ji came there and told her that the CM will not be able to meet her today. After this, she started talking to Vibhav Kumar ji in a loud voice and started pushing him and forcibly going inside. After this, security personnel were called and asked to take her out.

>This entire incident proves that this was a conspiracy hatched by the BJP and Swati Maliwal was made its face. The aim of this conspiracy was to trap Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

>Swati Maliwal ji went to the police after this incident, where she was asked to undergo medical examination but she refused.

>Three days after this, BJP again brought Swati Maliwal ji forward with a new lie. But today's video has made everything clear.

>When @SanjayAzadSln ji saw the news on media that Swati Maliwal had gone to the Police Station, then he met Swati Maliwal, till then he only had Swati's side in front of him.

>Now they also have Vibhav ji's side of the story and the video that has come out today proves that all the things said in the FIR are lies.

Response from Swati Maliwal

>Like every time, this time also this political hitman has started efforts to save himself.

>By getting his people to tweet and playing videos without any context, he thinks he can save himself by committing this crime. Who makes a video of someone being beaten up? The truth will be revealed to everyone as soon as the CCTV footage of the house and the room is checked.

>This goon is threatening the party, if I get arrested I will reveal all the secrets. That is why he is roaming around in Lucknow and everywhere seeking shelter.

>Today, under his pressure, the party gave in and to save a goon, my character was questioned by the entire party.

No matter how many mistakes this Goverment does, the only national party who can challenge BJP is sadly Congress who has been rudderless with no party chief.

The Congress is not ready to take advantage of the missteps of this Goverment. Rahul Gandhi is not putting his heart and soul into fighting the state elections and empowering state leadership.

In next couple of years we are going to see Congress being replaced by smaller regional parties. They might form a Goverment but I don't think it'll last and will be bad for the country.

BJP has most of the media rooting for them and will cover their mistakes.

If Congress wants to win they have to rethink their strategy and play smart. Get leaders who are in 24/7 campaigning mode. Raise funding and increase volunteers. Start door to door aggressive campaigning 6 months before the election. Raise local issues and try avoiding criticizing Modi. Instead criticize the local BJP state leaders and ignore Modi.

>In November 2013 the so-called ""snoopgate"" scandal broke when two websites, Cobrapost.com and Gulail.com, obtained audio recordings of telephone conversations in which Modi's right-hand man Amit Shah directed the illegal surveillance of a young woman in late 2009, at Modi's request. The surveillance included tapping her phone, tailing her family, and even monitoring her movements outside the state boundaries. The [BJP](http://daily.bhaskar.com/trending-topics/lok%20sabha%20election%20/) admitted that Modi had used the state government machinery to monitor the young woman, claiming the surveillance, although without her knowledge, was at the request of her father (which would still be illegal). A judicial panel has now been set up to probe the affair.

The BJP has dismissed the charges as part of ""dirty tricks"" by the Congress in the lead-up to the polls.

Exit polls been released after the conclusion of one of the most controversial general election in India. Most of the polls have given a huge majority to the BJP-led NDA. This has provoked widespread concern among the common people. I have received dozens of messages and calls from friends expressing a sense of uncertainty about what the future may hold for India. These anxieties are not misplaced.

The two terms of BJP saw growing authoritarianism and communalism. Institutions were compromised and turned into a political weapon. Activists, journalists, academicians, and dissenters were persecuted and imprisoned. Protests were crushed by force. Education system was slowly saffronised. Media was turned into a propaganda arm of the Government, which buried issues of public interest. Hate speeches and violence against minorities was normalized. Religious festivals were captured by a political mob. Parliament was forcibly captured, disallowing the opposition to speak. Federalism was slowly eroded. With draconian laws, Modi Government had virtually created a Police Raj in India. The nation was already moving towards a fascist state.

Meanwhile, as the country went to elections, BJP embarked on a campaign of communalism and hate. The model code of conduct was torn to shreds, while the election commission refused to take any action against BJP leaders, despite repeated complaints. Opposition candidates were intimidated to withdraw their nomination. Media was used to run an open propaganda for the ruling party. Religion was openly used for election campaign.

In the meantime, despite insurmountable odds, we did try our best to prevent the return of the BJP. Tens of thousands of people, young and old, tirelessly campaigned for months. Many people made huge sacrifices to give us a glimmer of hope, a small chance at victory. I wrote dozens of articles, documents, urging people to rise up and fight against the fascism.

In all honesty, I do not believe that the exit polls are right. And, that the BJP may remain much below 272. There has been widespread disenchantment and anger against the BJP Government. People raised the issues of livelihood, like unemployment and price rise, as well as rise of authoritarianism and assault on constitution. Many local protests were observed as well.  However, if the predictions of the exit polls does come indeed true, we must recognize, that we will have to face dark times ahead. 

If, after June 4, Modi Government returns to power, country will inevitably regress into a full-blown fascism. The activists and journalists who speak against the regime will be put in jail. All the facts and data will be suppressed. Media will further deteriorate into a pure and ugly propaganda, that will target common citizens and sing praises for our non-biological Prime Minister. Broadcast Regulations bill, and various suppression will ensure that even social media will not be available as a source of information. Violence and hate-speeches will become a norm. Opposition will be crushed. Most importantly, as Dr Parakala Prabhakar warned,

> Do not expect further elections in India, the Constitution will be changed. The hate speeches and calls for violence that you are hearing in rallies and Dharam Sansads, will be heard from Red Fort.

This is not scaremongering or pessimism, but an imminent and inevitable truth.

The first casualty will, however, be our right to protest. A people's movement is the greatest thorn in Modi's side, one that will be outlawed at the earliest.

The question that remains before us, is what needs to be done now. In an earlier article, written on the Desecration of the Indian Republic, I had pondered the same.

v0p4u1,1653874029.0,theslain,You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.,"Most of you guys would remember the old days when Congress was in power, in a coalition with many parties and the popular wisdom was that coalition politics is here to stay, and inevitable in a diverse country like ours. I was always interested in analysing politics and naturally criticised it as much and often as I could. There were so many wrong things with the Congress, not only the dynastic tendency in the top leadership (which made other leaders hopeless of ever vying for leadership), but also the blatant internal corruption and “Sarkari naukri” style attitude of many of its ministers and leaders. Chidambaram, Sibal, Antony, Digvijay all seemed to me as career politicians who would never lead India to the heights we all want. I also spoke out against Manmohan Singh especially because of the India-US nuclear deal and the Nirbhaya case of 2012.

But you know what? I miss UPA and wish they were back. We actually had a decent government. Manmohan Singh, often ridiculed as being controlled by Gandhis and being “quiet”, understood his role as PM perfectly and managed his cabinets well. He had the perfect temperament and personality to be accepted by all regions of India. Noble, hardworking and absolutely neutral, Manmohan Singh actually ranks at #1 in my Best PMs list.

Why do I miss the UPA so much? Because I have seen my beloved country choose a path that will one day come back to haunt us. Starting with our Supreme Leader, who portrays a strongman style leadership. In fact, he actually acts like a King and it feels like a monarchy more than an electoral democracy. His mannerisms and behavioural style with the common people is exactly how a typical monarch would deal with lowly subjects in a feudal setting. Just about everyone knows that he’s propped up by his party as a leader but the brains of the operation is Shah, about whom people have forgotten that he languished in jail before his buddy seized power. In 2014, riding on a massive anti-incumbency wave, the people thought that the natural alternative to congress was BJP, Advani was too old, and Modi had been making news for his Gujarat model. The people took a chance on them, not knowing what we were in for.

Since 2014 I have seen a seismic shift in our economic ideology. Straightaway the Planning Commission was tossed out. BJP made this country shed just about every bit of socialist policies it had. This resulted in the  Public sector essentially getting murdered and rural job guarantees being taken away. In our country the best economic model is a mixed economy, as there HAS to be a good amount of economic equality (socialism) along with economic growth (capitalism). If you stop taking steps to ensure economic equality, you let capitalists have a free run in the land. We have seen Ambani and other super rich compound their riches and businesses, Adani springing out of nowhere to monopolise industry and shut down competition. God only knows what kind of other benefits their brethren enjoys. Their defence is that they’ve given us a better startup ecosystem and easier platform to do business. Now on cover it sounds amazing and positive, but to those of you who actually have startups, you know exactly how tough it is for small businesses to compete in the Indian market which is riddled with monopolies and anti-competition values. Alarm bells should be ringing as our country gets more and more unequal, impoverished and silently angry. 

Let’s come to the main policy of this government which is making people increasingly associate Hinduism with BJP. They have us by the balls. An average Indian is deeply religious, and because of religion’s bad characteristic of making humans believe in a “us vs them” situation, many Hindus have become “aware” of supposed threats to Hinduism as a whole, with identification of targets (Muslims) as those responsible. Religious tension was always a feature of Independent India, but India was also a very tolerant and welcoming place in a majority of places. This is no longer a case. Hindu supremacy and anti-muslim hatred is now the  hard fact in most of the land. Did we ever see a Madhya Pradesh so violent and irrational? Did we ever consider see Karnataka in the news for such bigotry? 

As a political analyst by hobby, let me state some cold hard facts. Indians are being socially engineered to become homogeneous. Indians are witnessing a fascist and authoritarian wave. Indians are only expected to pay taxes, pray to God and be good consumers. Indians are witnessing generational wealth in small families evaporate. Indians are fed propaganda everyday through every medium possible. Indians are now being led by a government that will do everything to win elections and stay in power for as long as possible. That includes setting up trolls and bots on social media, paying the media and setting up jingoistic channels like News18 and ZeeNews, suppressing opposition by use of government power. (About EVM rigging: nothing has been proven so I’m silent about it. But I do think we should go back to ballots.)


This is why I miss UPA and coalition politics. I wish regional powers like DMK, BJD, TRS, YSRCP, RJD, TMC, SP, BSP, AAP, SS, NCP, JD(S), CPI(M), SAD come together and play a role in electing an alternative government in 2024. 

Although we all know the result of that election already",183,77
nm5biv,1622114897.0,letsdosomethingcool,Who do you think would be an ideal PM candidate against Modi in 2024?,"A lot has been said time and again that there’s no alternative to Modi, that’s why many even though unwillingly voted Modi back in power in 2019. Many of us fall prey to BJP IT Cell’s mockery of Rahul Gandhi as a Leader. Though he may have his own weaknesses like all others but I see him as the only one who is going head-to-head with BJP stalwarts and standing up with a spine against Modi. However, I believe if Indian National Congress keep on projecting Rahul Gandhi as a PM candidate, Modi will be able to easily sail through not just in 2024 but also in 2029 if he remains fit and healthy given the bad PR it has managed to build to discredit Rahul Gandhi.

The opposition parties always seem to be fighting each other especially because of their regional foothold and over-confidence. None of their leaders except Rahul Gandhi is able to be vocal and give voice to public sentiments against the failure of Modi Government on multiple aspects — For instance from ‘Surender Modi’, ‘Chowkidar Chor Hai’, ‘Suit Boot Ki Sarkar’,  to Giving Conclusive Suggestions on Pandemic Management, Vaccination Strategy, Economic Policy Suggestions, etc. Acceptance of Government or the Public is a different ball game, but what I am trying to say is that whatever he is doing, it looks he is the only reasonable candidate the Opposition can pitch for. And if others are not able to portray themselves then it’s not the fault of Rahul Gandhi as he can only and only control INC but not other political parties.

So based on this analogy, what do you think who could be a better candidate for 2024 to go against Modi. If you think it should only be Rahul Gandhi again then what should he do to overcome the BJP IT Cell’s Fake propaganda spreading machinery which sells his video footage of half baked sentences to discredit him. For example; In a video footage where Rahul Gandhi can be seen saying “Idhar Se Aaloo Dalo Udhar Se Sona Niklega,” and it was used to malign him and question his intellect, whereas, in reality He said that ‘Narendra Modi had told Potato farmers that he’ll give them a machine which can be used to mint gold from one side by putting potato from the other side’.

From what I perceive of Indian Politics, only a handful politicians or I would say political leaders which include Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Mayawati, Nitish Kumar, Mamta Banerjee, are PM aspirants but they can never be the PM candidate because they are only and only limited to a region, whereas INC because of a larger base of its workers and vote bank, irrespective of the seats it hold in the Parliament now, has a significant role to play. And in INC except Shashi Tharoor, P Chidambram, Anand Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Kapil Sibbal, no other political leader can be suggested.

Shashi Tharoor is fighting a murder charge case.
Anand Sharma is not widely known — not a popular face as such.
Ghulam Nabi Azad — He will be discredited just because he is a Muslim.
Kapil Sibbal — He’ll be targeted for 2G scam.
P Chidambram — Fighting Aircel-Maxis deal case and some others.

I don't understand this whole idea of image. What image and whose image are we talking about. One second its defaming India's image in front of the world and when foreign media, who voice the supposed countries that adore India's image, criticize this government and circumstances, then they're conspirators and paid by Congress. 

I need help understanding what we mean by ""image of India""

Rahul Gandhi- I really want to like this guy but then again it's really hard to like him. I mean the other guy he was saying he has all the info against Modi and then he went all silent. Only  good thing is he is not stubborn. And he is not proven at any level. Modi was RSS guy to CM before he was PM. 

Kejriwal-  Had huge hopes on him and his party. But now they became just another political party- at least that's how it looks from outside.

Nitish Kumar - I think he is capable but I can't see him becoming PM.

CPM - not enough foothold to make a difference.

Trinamool - Nah

Point is I don't see a strong rival for BJP. May be Congress may win next election (less likely ) but without a proper leader they will struggle. Along with all their good works , there will be those bad stuffs also.

I am not an active follower of politics (state and national ), but this government is worse . I mean you make any criticism then you are anti national. Always bringing in army, our ""ancient culture"", lots of agendas even for movie censorship, stuff like that. Thought UPA was very liberal. They didn't give any shit. You could make all those funny MMS Singham videos, Italy reference,RaGa jokes etc. Except for that 2G scam....",6,51
12f9dlf,1680923089.0,LordMoosewala,Why doesn't youth want to talk about politics?,"So, I was going through the subreddit and realised much of the youth doesn't want to talk about politics at all. I was reading through Manish Sisodia's arrest, Satyendar Jain's arrest and Rahul Gandhi's arrest posts and most people are apathetic towards it. They simply don't care, and if you're that way, you're already a product, commodity for companies like Cambridge Analytica and it's scary, because as claimed by Alexander nix, this is the first step towards their success, to make people apathetic, in any propaganda. 

I was watching the great hack  on Netflix and I'm pretty sure many of you have heard about Cambridge Analytica. A company who takes data from Meta (Facebook) and parses and predicts the voter's psychology, then targets them with propaganda ads.  The amount of similarities in Indian election campaigns made me wonder if they had a role in Indian elections, turns out, we were just puppets for them to experiment upon, so that they can strengthen themselves and change the presidency in USA, they were responsible for Trump's victory, a disgusting and disgraceful monster. Then we got to see Brexit, this ducking company literally single handedly divided the nation that divided the whole Earth, they played an Uno reverse on The Great Britain. It's just so ironic, England is no longer a part of EU, including Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland but Scotland wants to be a part of EU, the amount of turmoil and instability they caused is amazing. 

Sorry for going on a tangent but I just wanted to say how much power it has, how much power your data has that it can divide a country in 2020. Think what else it could do. We need to talk about the on going things, its hard to say what's right or what is wrong but some things just literally don't make sense, why wasn't Modi arrested himself for 2002? And Rahul is being arrested now, I'm not the one to stand with Congress, I hate congress but look at China and you'll realise what happens when you have no resistance. 

But India doesn't stop there, it takes the worst traits of USA, a hyper capitalist state and China's authoritativeness and combines it to make a poor and corrupt country, wait till you see the effects of Modi's rule in 2025 onwards. For those who don't know, it takes around 10 years for the effects of policies laid to start showing effects. India might be fastest growing GDP even rn but its GDP per capita is so poor that its hard to look at, even GDP per capita isn't a true representation, the corporates can't even balance it out. 

Companies and some parties don't want you to talk about politics, become apathetic, so that you can be shifted to voting for them, and it works, and people don't even realise their minds have been altered. I'm currently doing computer science and the amount of data these companies have on you is mind blowing, not that i know a lot but i just downloaded my data and I'm speechless. I think the woke culture was actually representative of something else than what the right wing has made it to appear like. 

People who don't have their own opinion is what these companies and these politicians want, because the more apathetic people, the more potential voters, just a little bit of wind of ads to target and boom. These companies know more about you than you do, not saying it as a part of woke culture or anything but in terms of your conscience, you need to wake up and learn to resist, bc if you just want to succumb to these shitheads, nothing can save you. Youth will suffer, for jobs for housing and for surviving. 

I'm a gen z too btw, I know it is depressing to look at but at least know where you're being manipulated, I'm not asking you to be left or right winged but you've every right to know what they are doing with your data. Cambridge Analytica had 5000 data points on ever American voter, they knew 5000 psychology points of you, that even you cannot tell about yourself. It is impossible to stay unbiased these days but trying to be aware that they want you to fall into this, they want you to not talk, they want to manipulate you is a must, nothing can help you, other than yourself. 

After 2018, there has been no mention of Cambridge Analytica in India, do you think it still affects elections? Christopher Wylie did openly commit to affecting elections previously. What do you guys think about this? Is it worth raising a voice, or is it too late already?

Exit poll or May 16th is just a formality to say in the end that Modi will be Our PM for next 5 yrs. I am as you people say, an Aaptard, and still I am happy with the prospects of new India under Modi. I believe AAP has revolutionized our election. I am certain that 66% turnout in this election is a result of whole India against corruption movement, even people who gave their votes to BJP or congress must have awakened by AAP in some way. But lets face AAP is a much better opposition than INC for BJP. Winning matters, but it's less joy-able against weak opponents, Most of us knew time has came for congress to either change or die forever. Aap has risen to become a worthy opponent.
I don't believe in these poll results for Aap, it's just ridiculous that even after Delhi mistake they under estimate Aap. Thinking about this scenario with a eye on future I see bad times. why a party is getting so much ridiculed for cleaning politics, who would have thought that we, Indian youth will be talking about politics, we had accepted that leaders are corrupt, they will not change, this system can't change and we have to live like that. But when we see someone doing something to make it better why is that I see a lot of stupid people making fun of AK or Aap.

Why you people have forgotten INC, they are responsible that we are where we were 5 yrs back. I like that India will not be like UP, where Maya and Mulayam romance people alternately. Aap is just what was required for a country with 50% population under 25yrs age.
I don't want similar parties, fighting each other during election and then become girlfriend to one in power.

We need behave for younger ones who are watching us from their phone or lappy, they are like a blank paper, and this sub-reddit has become a joke, literally I laugh when I see people posting some funny stuff, (Bazingaa) don't change reddit to facebook (share all those stuff there).
I am just requesting that behave as if you know what your opinion matters, and their are children stalking internet and absorbing these things. Start to respect and admire the good work done by others.
Imagine 5yrs later (Modi retires, BJP is already divided, INC will rise again, and no AAP), Now my question is are you all ready to take responsibility if similar situation arises(2004-2014) in 2019?

It's not about Modi or BJP or INC or Aap, it's about our future, it's about us.
Look at us, we still talk about giving water or safety to women after 67 yrs of independence. Having/making a opposition who are a constant pain in the ass is also our responsibilities. Our politicians are lazy, we need to keep pushing them by any means.

Before AIB very few did what they were doing and they've made commendable progress for themselves and the Indian comedy scene alike. A whole generation of comedians and channels were inspired to pursue comedy as it became a lot more mainstream in India.

Their generic formatted videos with increased political correctness and what can only be described as a drought of comedy has really taken them off the edge and has placed them in the back seat.
